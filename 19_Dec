	\section{Introduction}

(Find updated data on missing baryon fraction). It is currently assumed that the missing baryons are found in the IGM, largely comprised of warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). The temperatures in these regions is typically about $10^5 K< T<10^7 K$. The problem with the IGM is that it is hard to trace by the $Ly \alpha$ forest and the emission strength in the UV and X-ray bands is too weak to be detected. A promising probe is the SZ effect. The complete ionization of the universe after reionization completed at a redshift of about $z=6$, means that free electrons are dominating the ICM and the less overdense filamentary structures of the IGM. Inverse compton scattering of CMB photons with ionized electrons gives rise to the SZ effect. Due to the electric neutrality of the universe and the coulombic forces of attraction between protons and electrons, the electrons in the IGM will trace the missing baryons thought to reside in the same region. The SZ consists of thermal and kinetic. The thermal arises from the thermal motion of electrons and is proportional to the electron temperature while the kSZ is the result of bulk motions of electrons and is thus proportional to bulk peculiar velocity. Now, the thermal SZ is strongly dependent on the electron density and thus the tSZ dominates in high density and temperature regions such as the ICM. We have already said that the missing baryons are more likely to reside in the warm-hot regions in less overdense filaments of the IGM, so the use of the tSZ is not ideal. A more promising avenue is the kSZ since the velocity considered is a large scale field, determined by the large scale gravitational potential, and is thus less biased by the local environment. Now that we have established that the kSZ is an unbiased prove for missing baryons, let us actually discuss the possibility of detecting this signal. (dusty star forming galaxies are a contamination, even planck with multiple bands has limited angular resolution and suffers-can discuss this further if you choose to discuss Hand). A severe problem which greatly reduces our chances of using the kSZ effect for the missing baryons is the projection effect. The signal is a measure of electron momentum from today until the EoR, which means redshift information of the missing baryons cannot be isolated and is instead accumulated together. We are also introducing a bias since reionization could contribute a lot to the kSZ effect and if we are more interested in detecting missing baryons at late times using the kSZ signal, it would be preferable to isolate the correct redshift period so we do not misinterpret reionization as our missing baryon signal. 

In this thesis we propose a method to

\section{Cosmology and Radio Telescopes}
	
\subsection{Standard Model}

\subsubsection{Cosmological principle}

The cosmological principle strictly assumes that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales, meaning that the universe looks the same at any point in the universe, and in any direction. Thus, the earth and Milky way galaxy do not exist in any special place in the universe. This is a principle which is fundamental to cosmology as it asserts that observations carried out on earth (to which we are currently restricted) are representative of the laws governing the whole universe, and thus our results ought to be comparable to those measured by alien life forms situated in galaxies light years away. Observational evidence for the cosmological principle has been found with the homogeneity of galaxy surveys on large scales and near-isotropy of the CMB. 


\subsubsection{The Expanding Universe}

The concept of a static universe was debunked when Edwin Hubble provided observational evidence for the expansion of the universe, with the recession of distant galaxies from us. This effect of galaxies moving away from each other and from us is conveniently described with the scale factor, $a$, which is set to the maximum value $a=1$ at present time. We can quantify the rate at which the scale factor changes, by introducing the Hubble rate given by 

\begin{equation} \label{Hubbles rate}
H(t)=\frac{da/dt}{a}
\end{equation}

Hubble's findings showed that there was a linear relation between velocity and distance, which is given by aptly named 'Hubble's law': $v=H_0 D$, where $H_0= H(t=0)$ is the Hubble constant defined at present time.

Now, if a galaxy is moving away from us, the observed wavelength will be larger than the wavelength emitted by the galaxy. We say that the galaxy has been redshifted and thus we can define the stretching factor, $z$, which gives the simple relation 

\begin{equation} \label{redshift eqn}
1+z=\frac{\lambda_{obs}}{\lambda_{emit}}=\frac{1}{a}
\end{equation}



\subsubsection{General relativity}

In this section we will discuss the very necessary tool of general relativity, developed by Einstein, which has endured for more than a century and has been vital in defining our cosmology. General relativity is reliant on the distortion of space-time by massive objects, with more mass causing a greater distortion. In other words, Einstein was the first to describe gravity as a geometric effect. In this section I will discuss the FRW metric used, before continuing onto Einsteins field equations, which will regrettably be discussed at a length disproportionate to its importance in cosmology, and conclude with the equations used to define the evolution of energy and density parameters. \\



\noindent \textbf{Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric}

The general form for the space-time interval in four dimensions is 

\begin{equation}\label{space-time interval}
ds^2 = g_{\mu \nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu 
\end{equation} 

with the first co-ordinate representing time and three spatial co-ordinates. The $g_{\mu \nu}$ is symmetric, and is expressed in the Minkowski space-time as

\[
g_{\mu \nu}= \eta_{\mu \nu}=
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]

For an expanding universe, the metric is altered to account spatial expansions by scale factor, $a(t)$, and no temporal expansion, giving us the metric for an expanding, flat universe

\[
g_{\mu \nu}= 
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & a^2(t) & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & a^2(t) & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & a^2(t) \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]

The zero contribution from off-diagonal terms is a result of the assumed isotropy of the universe, since there are no preferred directions, and likewise the homogeneity gives an assumed lack of spatial preference, which is also encoded in the metric.  
 
Thus, our space-time interval in equation \ref{space-time interval} becomes

\begin{equation}
ds^2 = -dt^2 + a^2(t) \delta_{ij} dx^i dx^j
\end{equation}

with the diagonal Kronecker delta of $\delta_{ij} = (1,1,1)$ for $i,j=1,2,3$, as defined for a flat universe only. 

Expressing the space-time metric in spherical co-ordinates for a closed, open or flat universe, gives the general expression

\begin{equation}
ds^2 = -dt^2 + a^2(t) \left[ \frac{dr^2}{1-kr^2} + r^2(d\theta^2 + sin^2\theta d\phi^2)\right]
\end{equation}

where $(r, \theta, \phi)$ are the spherical co-ordinates. The variable, $k$, describes the curvature of the universe, with $k=-1, 0, 1$ for an open, flat or closed universe, respectively. We assume a flat universe. 

\textbf{Einstein's equation and the energy-momentum tensor}

With the inclusion of dark energy, we have the equation

\begin{equation}\label{Einsteins eqn with dark energy}
G^\mu_\nu + \Lambda g^\mu_\nu = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T^\mu_\nu
\end{equation}

 that relates the Einstein tensor, $G^\mu_\nu$, the cosmological constant, $\Lambda$ and energy-momentum tensor, $T^\mu_\nu$. For the case of a perfectly isotropic fluid, the tensor is expressed as a diagonal matrix with dependencies on fluid pressure, $P$ and energy density, $\rho$. 
 
 \[
 T^{\mu}_{\nu}= 
 \begin{pmatrix}
 -\rho c^2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & P & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & P & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & P \\
 \end{pmatrix}
 \]
 
 
Substituting the tensor  $T^\mu_\nu$ into Einstein's equation, gives the equations commonly referred to as the Friedmann and acceleration equations, which are quoted here with their dependencies on curvature and the cosmological constant. 

\begin{equation}\label{friedmann eqn}
H^2 = \left( \frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{8 \pi G }{3}\rho - \frac{kc^2}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3}
\end{equation}

This equation can be simplified and rearranged to give us the expression for the critical density of a spatially flat universe ($k=0$) at present time, if the cosmological constant is negligible. 

\begin{equation}
\rho_c = \frac{3 H_0 ^2}{8 \pi G}
\end{equation}



The acceleration equation, expressed in full here with a non-negligible cosmological constant, is given as

\begin{equation} \label{acceleration eqn}
\dot{H} + H^2 = \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = - \frac{4 \pi G }{3}\left(\rho + \frac{3P}{c^2}\right) + \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3}
\end{equation}

Notice that the acceleration equation does not have explicit dependence on the curvature of the universe. 

\textbf{Conservation law and equation of state}

We can combine equations \ref{friedmann eqn} and \ref{acceleration eqn} to obtain the conservation law

\begin{equation} \label{conservation law}
a^{-3} \frac{\partial [\rho c^2 a^3] }{\partial t} = -3 \frac{\dot{a}}{a} P
\end{equation}

Now, using the knowledge that matter has zero pressure, we can obtain the relation between the matter energy density with scaling factor. The simple expression is

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial [\rho_m a^3]}{\partial t} = 0
\end{equation}

so that $\rho_m \propto a^{-3}$. This is expected since density is inversely proportional to volume.

For radiation, we have $P=\rho/3$, which gives the expression

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \rho_r}{\partial t} + \frac{\dot{a}}{a} 4 \rho_r = a^{-4} \frac{\partial [\rho_r a^4]}{\partial t} = 0
\end{equation}

Hence,  $\rho_r \propto a^{-4}$. This is also expected, though it differs from the scaling relation of the matter density, due to the decrease in photon energy as the light is redshifted due to universe expansion. 

The equation of state relates the pressure and energy density simply as 

\begin{equation}\label{equation of state}
P = w\rho c^2
\end{equation}

where $w$ is a constant of $w=0$ for dust (matter) particles, $w=1/3$ for radiation and $w=-1$ for the cosmological constant. Additionally, the spatial curvature can be treated as an additional fluid with $w=-1/3$. We can substitute equation \ref{equation of state} into equation \ref{conservation law} to obtain the evolution of energy density with time

\begin{equation}\label{energy density evolution}
\rho(t) = a^{-3(w+1)} (t) \rho_0
\end{equation}

We have already obtained scaling relations for matter and radiation, and these can be extended to expressions of the evolution of matter and radiation energy density as a function of time. Altogether, we write expressions for the energy density of radiation, matter, curvature and the cosmological constant. 

\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
\rho_r(t) = a^{-4} (t) \rho_{r,0}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\rho_m(t) = a^{-3} (t) \rho_{m,0}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\rho_k(t) = a^{-2} (t) \rho_{k,0}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\rho_\Lambda(t) = \rho_{\Lambda,0}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

where the quantities, $\rho_0$ are energy densities at present time. The cosmological constant does not evolve over time and instead remains constant throughout the universe expansion, as explicitly shown in the last equation. The order of the equations shows also the different eras of domination in the universe. The universe was initially radiation dominated, but as seen from the expressions, radiation energy density falls off faster than that of matter, resulting in a transition to matter domination. Matter-radiation equality occurred when $\rho_m = \rho_r$ so that the scale factor at the point when the universe had equal matter and radiation energy densities, is simply written as $a_{eq} = \frac{\rho_{r,0}}{\rho_{m,0}}$. Though the matter density succeeds the radiation domination for a time, both are eventually superseded by the dark energy whose domination is everlasting. 


\textbf{Density parameters}

Now that we have defined both the critical density and energy densities of individual energy densities, we can define density parameters as the ratio of the two

\begin{equation}
\Omega_i = \frac{\rho_i}{\rho_c}
\end{equation}

where $i=r,m,\Lambda,k$ for radiation, matter, dark energy and curvature, respectively. 

Thus, the Friedmann equation, \ref{friedmann eqn}, can be rewritten as

\begin{equation}
H^2 (t) = H_0^2 (a^{-4}(t) \Omega_{r,0} +a^{-3}(t) \Omega_{m,0} + a^{-2}(t) \Omega_{k,0} + \Omega_{\Lambda})
\end{equation}

\end{figure}

\newpage
\textbf{Evolution of the scale factor}

The evolution of the scale factor is obtained by substituting equation \ref{energy density evolution} into equation \ref{friedmann eqn}, with $\Lambda=0$ since the evolution of the scale factor is dependent on the energy density of the universe. Note that this expression is only applicable for the matter and radiation dominated eras of a flat universe. 

\begin{equation}
a(t) = a_0 \left( \frac{t}{t_0} \right)^{\frac{2}{3(w+1)}} 
\end{equation}

Therefore, we have the expressions $a(t) \propto t^{1/2}$ for radiation and $a(t) \propto t^{2/3}$ for matter. We have the universe expanding in both radiation and matter dominated eras, as expected. The evolution of the scale factor in the dark energy domination, in which the energy density is constant, is increasing exponentially, i.e. $a(t) \propto e^{Ht}$. 



\subsubsection{Distances}

Measuring distance in an expanding universe is deceptive in its simplicity. Though the distance distinctions are not too difficult to understand, failure to establish commonality of terms for these different distance measurements would lead to a tumult of confusions.  \\

We have discussed the scale factor already. If we picture space as a grid with assigned coordinates, the physical distance between two points on the grid will change if the grid expands, while the coordinates will remain unchanged. Thus, the comoving distance remains unchanged while the physical distance is proportional to the scale factor by which the grid expanded. We define the proper distance and comoving distance first, before discussing the angular diameter distance and luminosity distance thereafter. \\

\textbf{Proper distance}

This equation describes the physical distance between an observer at present time and a distant object at redshift, $z$. It is described as the simple distance that light travels in a given time, with time thereafter re-expressed as a function of scale factor, $a$, and energy densities so that the dependencies of the proper distance on our cosmological assumption is made clear. 

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
D_{proper}(z) = c \int_{t(z)}^{t_0} dt =\frac{c}{H_0} \int_{a(z)}^{a(z_0)} \frac{da}{\sqrt{a^{-1}\Omega_{m,0} + (1-\Omega_{m,0} - \Omega_{\Lambda}) + a^2 \Omega_{\Lambda}}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation} 


\textbf{Comoving distance}

Proper distances are not commonly used, replaced instead with comoving distance. The total comoving distance that light could have traveled is 

\begin{equation}
\eta = \int_0^t \frac{dt}{a(t)}
\end{equation}

This distance is so important since this is the furthest comoving distance that light could have traveled since the beginning of time. If we are instead interested in the comoving distance between a distant galaxy and us, which is usually the case, we can express the comoving distance as follows

\begin{equation}
\chi (a) = \int_{t(a)}^{t_0} \frac{dt}{a(t)} = \int_a^1 \frac{da}{H(a)} = \int_0^z \frac{c dz}{H(z)} 
\end{equation}

The conversion from time, $t$, to scale factor, $a$, was obtained using the Hubble rate defined in equation \ref{Hubbles rate} and the conversion to redshift was then obtained using the equation \ref{redshift eqn}. 

\textbf{Angular diameter distance}

In astronomy it is common to define the angle, $\theta$, subtended by an object of known size, $l$. 

\begin{equation}
d_A = \frac{l}{\theta}
\end{equation}

In a flat universe the angular diameter distance is

\begin{equation}
d_A = a \chi(a) = \frac{\chi(z)}{1+z}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Luminosity distance}

For a static universe, we have the familiar expression relating flux, $F$, and intrinsic brightness, $L$ as a function of the distance that the light travels, $d$. 

\begin{equation}
F=\frac{L}{4 \pi d^2}
\end{equation}

For an expanding universe, we consider a comoving shell that forms a sphere around the source situated at the centre. The luminosity is affected by the number density of photons passing through the comoving spherical shell per unit time, with more photons passing through at early times than at late times, due to reduced proper distance at early times. We therefore have a $1/a$ reduction in intrinsic brightness due to universe expansion. We also must factor in the reduced energy of photons as they are redshifted, giving a further reduction of $1/a$ in source brightness. Thus, the corrected flux equation is

\begin{equation}
F=\frac{L a^2}{4 \pi \chi (a)^2}
\end{equation}

Comparing these two equations gives the luminosity distance as

\begin{equation}
d_L=\frac{\chi}{a} = \chi (1+z)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Inflation}



\subsubsection{Matter Power Spectrum}

\textbf{Statistics of the density field}

Consider two galaxies at spatial positions, \textbf{x} and \textbf{y}. We can define a statistical function, called the correlation function, which gives the excess probability of finding two overdense regions separated by the distance $|\textbf{x} - \textbf{y}|$. This function is computed by taking the expectation value of the product of the two density fields $\delta(\textbf{x})$ and $\delta(\textbf{y})$, where quantity $ \delta(\textbf{x})$ represents the dimensionless matter overdensity by computing the density at a region, $\rho(\textbf{x})$,  relative to the density over all space, $\bar{\rho}$

\begin{equation}
\delta(\textbf{x}) = \frac{\rho(\textbf{x}) - \bar{\rho}}{\bar{\rho}}
\end{equation}

The correlation function is then written as

\begin{equation}\label{correlation function}
\epsilon(\textbf{x}, \textbf{y})  = \epsilon(|\textbf{x}- \textbf{y}|) = \left<\delta(\textbf{x}) \delta(\textbf{y}) \right>
\end{equation}

Note that in the second equality we have used the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy to write the argument of the correlation function as the distance between the two points only.

Now, let us take the overdensity, $\delta(\textbf{x})$ and write its fourier transform so that we can obtain the matter density as a function of the wavevector, \textbf{k}.  

\begin{equation}
\delta(\textbf{k}) = \int d^3 \textbf{x} e^{-i \textbf{k}. \textbf{x}} \delta (\textbf{x})
\end{equation}

We can then take the expectation value of the density field in \textbf{k} space, analogous to equation \ref{correlation function}

\begin{equation}
\left< \delta_m (\textbf{k}) \delta_m (\textbf{k}') \right> = (2\pi)^3 \delta^3_D(\textbf{k} - \textbf{k}') P_{mm}(k)
\end{equation}

where we have defined the dark matter density power spectrum, $	P_{mm}(k)$ which is dependent on the scalar k mode due to isotropy. It is clear from the above 3 equations that the power spectrum is the Fourier transform of the correlation function. 

We can also define the power spectrum of the gravitational potential, $\Phi$, which is related to the matter density through the Poisson's equation, 

\begin{equation}
\Phi = \frac{4 \pi G \bar{\rho}_m a^2 \delta_m}{k^2}
\end{equation} 

\textbf{Evolution of the gravitational potential}

We wish to understand how the distribution of matter which we observe today evolved between now and inflation. We therefore set up a simple equation to explain this process.

\begin{equation}
\Phi (\textbf{k}, a) = \Phi_p (\textbf{k}) T(k) D(a)
\end{equation}

with the scale factor dependent potential, $\Phi (\textbf{k}, a)$ equal to the primordial potential set up by inflation, $\Phi_p (\textbf{k})$ multiplied by the evolution of the perturbations through the radiation and matter eras and then multiplied by the growth function, $D(a)$, which defines the evolution at late times (during dark energy domination). 

We will give analytic expressions for the transfer function after briefly describing the evolution of large and small scale modes during the radiation and matter eras. Just to quickly iterate over what has been mentioned already regarding the expanding universe, we can consider the universe to be an expanding box and within the box we have a range of perturbations of different wavelengths. The size of the box is referred to as the horizon, $\eta$, which is the longest distance that light could have traveled since the beginning of time. The large wavelength modes have $\lambda>>\eta$ and hence these modes enter the horizon ($\lambda = \eta$) much later in the universe's evolution, i.e. after matter domination has occurred. Therefore, the evolution of large scale modes is broken up into two sections: (i) how the modes evolve as they pass through the epoch of equality ($a=a_{eq}$) and (ii) how the modes evolve as they enter the horizon in the matter era. 
The converse is true for the small scale modes. In this instance, we have (i) modes entering the horizon during the radiation era and (ii) evolution of the small scale modes during the epoch of equality. We notice that the large scale modes are not very affected and we have an almost constant gravitational potential, with only a $10\%$ drop in $\Phi$ during the radiation-matter era transition. Because of this, we can approximate the transfer function to be 1 for large scale modes. Small scale modes have a very different evolution. Before discussing this, it is important to appreciate the dependence that matter growth has on gravity and pressure, with pressure suppressing the growth and gravity of course allowing accumulation of matter thereby creating more and more overdense regions. Since the pressure is higher in the radiation era, we would expect a reduced growth of matter perturbations, resulting in a logarithmic increase in $\delta$ for large k for $a<a_{eq}$ and corresponding oscillations in $\phi$ with a large decay due to universe expansion. The gravitational potential is constant for both large scale and small scale modes during the matter era with the density perturbations scaling as $\delta \propto a$. 

The transfer function is then set to 1 for $k<<k_{eq}$, where $k_{eq}$ is defined as the k modes entering the horizon at $a=a_{eq}$. For $k>>k_{eq}$, the transfer function is

\begin{equation}\label{transfer func small scale}
T(k) = 12 \left( \frac{k}{k_{eq}} \right)^{-2} In\frac{k}{8 k_{eq}}
\end{equation}

Now that we have discussed the radiation and matter eras, let us move on to the late times in which the growth function plays a role. We have stated already that there is little matter growth in the radiation era while in the matter era, growth scales as $\delta \propto a$. This is true for a flat universe. If we were to introduce curvature and dark energy, the growth of matter is suppressed. Therefore, we expect the structures observed today to have evolved the most during the matter era with little change in recent times. The growth function is expressed as

\begin{equation}
D(a) = \frac{5 \Omega_m H(a)}{2 H_0} \int_0^a \frac{da}{(a H(a)/H_0)^2}
\end{equation}

Now that we have all the separate components contributing to the gravitational potential evolution, we can put it all together to obtain the following expression at late times  

\begin{equation}
\Phi(\textbf{k}, a) = \frac{9}{10} \Phi_p (\textbf{k}) T(k) \frac{D(a)}{a}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Final power spectrum}

Now that we have an expression for $\Phi$, we can substitute this into the Poisson's equation above which then gives the relation between overdensity at late times and the primordial gravitational potential

\begin{equation}
\delta_m(\textbf{k}, a) = \frac{3k^2}{\Omega_m H_0^2} \Phi_p (\textbf{k}) T(k) D(a)
\end{equation}

The matter power spectrum at late times is then 

\begin{equation}
P(k,a) = 2\pi^2 \delta_H^2 \frac{k^n_s}{H_0^{n_s+3}} T^2(k) \left(\frac{D(a)}{D(a=1)}\right)^2
\end{equation}

We use $n_s=1$, which we can assume for a scale-invariant universe; an assumption further suggested by Planck results which set $n_s= 0.9655 \pm 0.0062$ (Planck 2018),  we find $P \propto k$ for large scales and substituting equation \ref{transfer func small scale} which gives $T(k) \propto k^{-2}$ for small scales, we obtain the relation, $P \propto k ^{-3}$ for small scales. This explains the shape of the power spectrum, which increases linearly at $k<k_{eq}$ with a peak at $k=k_{eq}$, and a decreasing spectrum for $k>k_{eq}$. 



\subsection{Cosmic Microwave Background}

\subsubsection{CMB Anisotropies}

\subsubsection{Kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect}

So far we have considered the effect of CMB photons scattered off electrons in the intracluster medium. Now, an additional effect arises from the motion of the cluster relative to the CMB. This is the KSZ effect which is simply an expression of the resulting Doppler shift. In the non-relativistic limit, the CMB spectral distortion is given as
\begin{equation}\label{temp distortion due to ksz}
\frac{\delta T_{KSZ}}{T_{rad}}=\tau \frac{\nu_r}{c}cos\theta
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle between the observer and the direction of motion of the cluster, and $\nu_r$ is the radial component of the peculiar velocity of the cluster. We can write this in terms of intensity using Planck's radiation formula to obtain 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\delta I_{KSZ}}{I}=-x^4 \frac{e^x}{(e^x-1)^2}\tau \frac{\nu_r}{c}cos\theta
\end{equation}
Using equation \ref{temp distortion due to ksz} and substituting the expression for optical depth, $\tau$, we have 
\begin{equation}\label{p(theta) temp distortion ksz}
p(\vec{\theta})\equiv \frac{\delta T_{KSZ}}{T_{rad}}=\int_{0}^{\eta_0}n_e\sigma_Te^{-\tau}\left[\hat{\theta}.\frac{\vec{v}(\vec{\theta},\chi)}{c}\right]a(\chi)d\chi
\end{equation}
where $\vec{v}$ is the bulk velocity at distance $\vec{x}=\chi\vec{\theta}$ and the extra factor of $a(\chi)$ comes from the relation $dt=ad\chi$. 
The visibility function is the probability of photons scattering off ionised electrons and is given by
\begin{equation}
g(\eta)=-\dot{\tau}e^{-\tau} \Rightarrow g(\chi)= \overline{n_e}(\chi) \sigma_Ta(\chi)
\end{equation} 
where we have made the approximation that $e^{-\tau} \simeq 1$. The mean electron number density, $\overline{n}_e(z)=(1-(4-N_{He})Y/4)\Omega_{b0}\rho_{c0} x(z)(1+z)^3/m_p$ where $\Omega_{b0}$ is the baryon density today, $m_p$ is the proton mass and $x(z) \approx 1$ is the ionization fraction, which we assume for instantaneous reionization and for the ionization fraction today. 
Substituting this into equation \ref{p(theta) temp distortion ksz} gives
\begin{equation}\label{p as a function of theta}
p(\vec{\theta})=-\frac{1}{c}\int_{0}^{\eta_0} d\chi g(\chi)\hat{\theta}.\vec{q}(\vec{x}(\vec{\theta},\chi))
\end{equation}
where $\vec{q}(\vec{x})=(1+\delta_e(\vec{x}))\vec{v}_e(\vec{x})$, the product of the electron and density fields in real space. 
\noindent We can use Fourier conventions to find $q(\vec{k})$

Substituting equation \ref{IFT of delta m ito l} we have
\begin{equation}\label{p_kSZ of theta with l}
p(\vec{\theta})=-\frac{1}{c}\int d\chi \frac{g(\chi )}{\chi ^2}\int \frac{d^2 \vec{l}}{(2\pi)^2} e^{i \vec{l}.\vec{\theta}} \int \frac{dk_\parallel}{2\pi} e^{ik_{\parallel}\chi }\hat{\theta}.\vec{q}(\vec{k_\bot},k_\parallel,\chi )
\end{equation}

By comparing equations \ref{p_kSZ of theta with l} and \ref{FT of kappa of theta}, the equation for $p(\vec{l})$ is given by
\begin{equation}\label{final p(l) kSZ equation}
p(\vec{l})=-\frac{1}{c}\int d\chi  \widetilde{g}(\chi ) \int \frac{dk_\parallel}{2\pi} e^{ik_{\parallel}\chi } \hat{\theta}.\vec{q}(\vec{k_\bot},k_\parallel,\chi )
\end{equation}
where $\widetilde{g}(\chi)=\frac{g(\chi )}{\chi ^2}$.


\subsection{Neutral Hydrogen}

\subsubsection{Intensity Mapping}


Mapping the HI emission from individual galaxies requires very sensitive radio telescopes with high angular resolution. Although galaxy redshift surveys, such as DES and Euclid, have provided stringent constraints on cosmological parameters, we discuss an alternative that is more cost and time efficient. As a result, the sky coverage is limited which could lead to large shot noise at low redshifts. An alternative is intensity mapping (IM) which covers large sky areas in a reduced time by integrating all photons detected, thereby eliminating the problems which arise from resolving individual galaxies(Chang et al., 2008; Loeb and
Wyithe, 2008). We obtain three dimensional information of power spectra by measuring a range of angular fluctuations at different frequencies, which correspond to different redshifts. Although IM provides us with numerous advantages, there are shortcomings as well, one of which is foreground contaminations. Foregrounds are long wavelength, smoothly varying galactic signals that propagate in the line-of-sight (los) and which are orders of magnitude larger than the 21 cm signal. These cause contamination of the signal which we are trying to measure. A further limitation of IM experiments is that the angular fluctuations that can be probed using the radio interferometer are limited by the longest and shortest baselines while the radial fluctuations are limited by the bandwidth and frequency channel (the angular scale limitations differ for single-dish experiments but there are to-date no IM experiments carried out with single dish radio telescopes).
This technique is employed by many experiments currently, such as the Canadian Hydrogen
Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) (Vanderlinde and Chime Collaboration, 2014)),
the Baryon acoustic oscillations In Neutral Gas Observations experiment (BINGO) (Battye et al.,
2012) and Tianlai (Chen, 2015) as well as multi-purpose radio telescopes like MeerKAT (Booth and Jonas, 2012) and
the Square Kilometer Array (Santos et al., 2015). Upcoming experiments such as the Hydrogen Intensity and Real-time Analysis eXperiment
(HIRAX) will also make use of IM. Large volume intensity mapping surveys
are expected to result in cosmological constraints competitive with those from galaxy redshift
surveys (Bull et al., 2015).
We will focus on the use of HIRAX which will be operational in the Karoo in the next few years. HIRAX will consist
of 1024 dishes that are 6 m in diameter, which will be arranged in a close-packed structure that
makes use of redundant baselines.


\subsubsection{HI signal}

Structures such as galaxies contain large amounts of neutral hydrogen, the gas which is commonly known as star forming gas. Because of this, measuring 21 cm signals gives an indication of the LSS in the universe. We say that neutral hydrogen is a biased tracer of matter densities. The HI signal is measured using radio telescopes and due to redshift space distortions, the signal measured on Earth has been redshifted. Therefore, we have
\begin{equation}\label{delta HI to delta m}
\delta_{HI}(\vec{k})=\delta_m(\vec{k})[b_{HI}+f\mu_k^2]
\end{equation}
where $b_{HI}$ is the HI bias and $\delta_{HI}$ is the density contrast of the HI signal intensity. Now, the signal intensity measured from radio telescopes is related to temperature via Rayleigh-Jean's approximation, $I_\nu=2k_BT\frac{\nu^2}{c^2}$, for long wavelengths such as 21 cm. Since this approximation shows that the signal intensity is proportional to temperature, we have 
\begin{equation}\label{delta 21 ito k}
\begin{aligned}
\delta T_{21}(\vec{k};z_i)&=\overline{T}(z_i)\delta_{HI}(\vec{k};z_i)
\\&=\overline{T}(z_i)\delta_m(\vec{k};z_i)[b_{HI}+f\mu_k^2]
\\&=\overline{T}(z_i)D(z_i)\delta_m(\vec{k};z=0)[b_{HI}+f\mu_k^2]
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where the third equality comes from removing redshift dependance from $\delta_m$ and the mean temperature given by 
\begin{equation}\label{mean 21 cm temp}
\bar{T} \approx 566h \left(\frac{H_0}{H(z)}\right)\left(\frac{\Omega_{HI}}{0.003}\right)(1+z)^2 \mu K
\end{equation}
Expressing this in observational-space Fourier variables gives %\cite{bibid}
\begin{equation}\label{delta 21 ito y and l final eqn}
\delta T_{21}(\vec{l},y;z_i)=\frac{\delta T_{21}(\vec{k}_\bot,k_\parallel;z_i)}{(\chi )^2r_{\nu(z_i)}}
\end{equation}
where the expression for $y$ is given as
\begin{equation}\label{y eqn}
y=k_\parallel r_\nu
\end{equation}
with $r_\nu=\frac{c(1+z_i)^2}{H(z_i)}$. Using the relation $1+z=\frac{1420 MHz}{\nu}$ for observing frequency, $\nu$, we see that $y$ is the inverse of $\nu$. Note that in the equation, $z_i$ is used to denote a particular redshift bin.

\end{equation}
%where the different arguments account for the different possible modes of the velocity and density perturbations

%Need to change eqn 24. This v eqn is actually from the peculiar velocity eqn in dodelson.
%Eqn 28, maybe rewrite k in terms of k perp and k parallel and then apply dirac delta functions and then re express ito k thereafter, just to explain why k'=k, which we just sort of assume in equality 2 of eqn 28.

Computing the four point correlation with

gives

Now, we apply Wick's theorem for gaussian fields.
%The negative sign in the Cl expression below comes from replacing k_2 with -k_1 and k'' with -k' which only introduces a negative sign in the \left[\frac{\vec{k_2}-\vec{k}''}{|\vec{k_2}-\vec{k}''|^2}+\frac{\vec{k}''}{|\vec{k}''|^2}\right] term.

\subsubsection{kSZ signal-to-noise}

	\caption{The full OV signal is plotted with the CMB spectrum, $C_l^{TT}$ and the CMB noise, $N_l^{TT}$.}
	\label{fig:ovandcmbnoiseprelim}
\end{figure}

In order to determine CMB noise, we look at the detector noise of CMB experiments. The experiment that I am looking at is AdvACT. The detector noise is given as

\begin{equation}
N_l^{TT}=\sigma_p^2 e^{l^2 \theta_{beam}^2}
\end{equation}
where $\theta_{beam}=\theta_{fwhm}/8ln2$ is the beam width and $\sigma_p$ is the detector noise in a pixel of side $\theta_{beam}$. The detector noise is calculated using the 150 GHz channel of AdvACT. The total CMB noise is equal to the sum of the CMB spectrum and the CMB noise. Thus, $N_l^{kSZ} \equiv N_l^{CMB}=C_l^{TT}+N_l^{TT}$. 
Using the previously calculated kSZ variance, $(\sigma_l^{kSZ})^2$, the signal-to-noise can be calculated as $S/N=\sqrt{N_{modes}} \frac{C_l^{kSZ}}{\sigma_l^{kSZ}}$ where $N_{modes}=2l\Delta l f_{sky}$.

The specifications of the AdvACT experiment are 

\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l|l}
		\hline
		{\textbf{AdvACT}} &{\textbf{Value}}\\
		\hline
		Frequency channel (GHz) & $150$ \\
		\hline
		Beam size, $\theta_{beam}$ (arcmin) & $1.5$  \\
		\hline
		Temperature sensitivity, $\sigma_p$ ($\mu K$-arcmin) & $1.5$   \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{\label{tab:AdvACT} AdvACT specifications}
\end{table}

The angular power spectrum of the kSZ signal can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
C_l^{kSZ}=\left< p^{kSZ}(\vec{l}) p^{kSZ}(\vec{l})\right>
\end{equation}

The variance of the kSZ signal is written as

\begin{equation}\label{variance of kSZ}
\begin{aligned}
\delta^2(\vec{l}-\vec{l}')(\sigma_l^{kSZ})^2&=\left<C_l C_{l'}\right>-\left<C_l\right>\left<C_{l'}\right>\\
&=\left< \hat{p}(\vec{l})\hat{p}(\vec{l})\hat{p}(\vec{l}')\hat{p}(\vec{l}')\right>-\left<\hat{p}(\vec{l})\hat{p}(\vec{l})\right> \left<\hat{p}(\vec{l}')\hat{p}(\vec{l}')\right>\\
&=2\left<\hat{p}(\vec{l})\hat{p}(\vec{l}')\right>\left<\hat{p}(\vec{l})\hat{p}(\vec{l}')\right> +\left<\hat{p}(\vec{l})\hat{p}(\vec{l})\right>\left<\hat{p}(\vec{l}')\hat{p}(\vec{l}')\right>-\left<\hat{p}(\vec{l})\hat{p}(\vec{l})\right> \left<\hat{p}(\vec{l}')\hat{p}(\vec{l}')\right>
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where the kSZ noise is given as

\begin{equation}
\left< \hat{p}(\vec{l})\hat{p}(\vec{l}')\right>=\delta^2(\vec{l}-\vec{l}')(C_l^{pp}+N_l^{pp})
\end{equation}

This gives the variance of

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{kSZ}^2= 2(C_l^{pp}+N_l^{pp})^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\left(\frac{S}{N}\right)^2=&2 f_{sky}\int \frac{d^2l}{(2\pi)^2}\left(\frac{C_l^{kSZ}}{\sigma_l^{kSZ}}\right)^2 \\
=&2 f_{sky}\int \frac{dl}{2\pi}l\left(\frac{C_l^{kSZ}}{\sqrt{2}(C_l^{kSZ}+N_l^{kSZ})}\right)^2 \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The sky fraction, $f_{sky}$, is expressed as $f_{sky}=\frac{S_{area} (radians)}{2\pi}$. We plot the differential and cumulative signal-to-noise in Figures \ref{fig:snr-integrand} and \ref{fig:snr}.

\subsubsection{21 cm density signal}

	



The angular power spectrum for 21 cm temperature fluctuations is given by 
\begin{equation}\label{Cl 21 relation to autocorrelation}
\begin{aligned}
&\langle  \delta T_{21}(\vec{l},y;z_i) \delta T_{21}^*(\vec{l'},y';z_i)\rangle  =(2 \pi)^3\delta^2(\vec{l}-\vec{l'})\delta(y-y')C_l^{21}(y;z_i)
\\&
\Rightarrow C_l^{21}(y;z_i)=\int \frac{d^2\vec{l'}}{(2\pi)^2} \int \frac{dy'}{2\pi}\langle  \delta T_{21}(\vec{l},y;z_i) \delta T_{21}^*(\vec{l'},y';z_i)\rangle  
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Substituting equation \ref{delta 21 ito y and l final eqn} into equation \ref{Cl 21 relation to autocorrelation} gives
\begin{equation}
\Rightarrow C_l^{21}(y;z_i)=\int \frac{d^2\vec{l'}}{(2\pi)^2}\int \frac{dy'}{2\pi}\frac{(\overline{T}(z_i)D(z_i)[b_{HI}+f\mu_k^2])^2}{(\chi )^2 (\chi' )^2 r_{\nu}(z_i) r'_{\nu}(z_i)}\langle  \delta_m(\vec{k};z=0)\delta_m^*(\vec{k};z=0)\rangle  
\end{equation}
Expressing $\langle  \delta_m(\vec{k};z=0)\delta_m^*(\vec{k};z=0)\rangle  $ in terms of the matter power spectrum, we have
\begin{equation}
C_l^{21}(y;z_i)=\int \frac{d^2\vec{l'}}{(2\pi)^2}\int \frac{dy'}{2\pi}\frac{(\overline{T}(z_i)D(z_i)[b_{HI}+f\mu_k^2])^2}{(\chi )^2 (\chi' )^2 r_{\nu}(z_i) r'_{\nu}(z_i)}(2\pi)^3
\delta^2(\vec{k_{\bot}}-\vec{k'_\bot})\delta(k_{\parallel}-k'_\parallel)P_m(\vec{k})
\end{equation}
Substituting equations and applying the Dirac delta functions gives
\begin{equation}
C_l^{21}(y;z_i)=\frac{(\overline{T}(z_i)D(z_i)[b_{HI}+f\mu_k^2])^2}{(\chi )^2 r_{\nu}(z_i)}P_m(\vec{k})
\end{equation}


Integrating over all $y$ modes gives

\begin{equation}
C_l^{21}(y;z_i)=\int_{10^{-10}}^{10^{3}} \frac{dy}{2\pi}\frac{(\overline{T}(z_i)D(z_i)[b_{HI}+f\mu_k^2])^2}{(\chi )^2 r_{\nu}(z_i)}P_m(\vec{k})
\end{equation}

The variance, $\sigma_l^{HI}$ is given by

\subsection{21-21-kSZ Bispectrum}



\subsubsection{Definitions and notations}
We consider a single cube, centered at redshift, $z_*$, that is situated a comoving distance, $\chi_*$, away from us. We consider narrow redshift bins of $\Delta z \ll z_*$. The sides of the box correspond to the difference between the comoving distances set by the redshift bin, i.e. $L=\chi_{max} -\chi_{min}$, where $\chi_{max}=\chi(z_*+\Delta z)$ and $\chi_{min}=\chi(z_*-\Delta z)$. This setup is shown in Figure \ref{fig:diagram1stsep2019}, with $r$ representing the radial (line of sight) axis. The universe is approximated as a discrete set of these identical cubes, such that the total signal over a large redshift is computed by simply summing over the signals from each box. The redshift range which will be considered for HIRAX is $0.8-2.5$. We compute the cross-correlation of the kSZ and 21 cm fields by restricting the resulting signal to the limits set by the cube.\\
The kSZ signal is obtained by integrating over the line of sight, resulting in a 2D projected momentum field. The 2D sky, in our cube approximation, is considered to be a sum of the xy faces of the discrete set of identical cube described earlier. The angular separation between the edges of the square are defined as the length of the side, $L$, divided by the comoving distance, $\chi_*$. Thus, the transverse comoving distance is written as $\chi_{\perp}=\vec{\theta} \chi_*$ with the 2D angular vector, $\vec{\theta}=(\theta_1,\theta_2)$. Defined as well is the 3D line of sight unit vector, $\hat{\theta}=(\theta_1,\theta_2,1)$. \\
The kSZ momentum field is composed of the electron density and velocity fields. It is defined in $\theta$ space as 

\begin{equation}
p_{kSZ}(\vec{\theta})=-\frac{1}{c}\int_{\chi_{min}}^{\chi_{max}} d\chi g(\chi)\hat{\theta}.\vec{q}_e(\chi_* \vec{\theta},\chi)
\end{equation}

%WE DONT WRITE \VEC{P}_{KSZ} I THINK BECAUSE KSZ MOMENTUM IS ISOTROPIC SO NO DIRECTION SPECIFICATION REQUIRED, SO ITS A SCALAR

with $\vec{q}_e(\vec{x})=\vec{v}_e(\vec{x}) \delta_e (\vec{x})$. 

Using Fourier transforms, we can express $\vec{k}$ as

\begin{equation}
f(\vec{x})=\int \frac{d^3 \vec{k}}{(2 \pi)^3} e^{i\vec{k}.\vec{x}}f(\vec{k})
\end{equation}


The velocity in $k$ space is defined according to the continuity equation

\begin{equation}
\vec{v}(\vec{k})=\frac{ifaH\delta(\vec{k},z)}{k^2}\vec{k}\\
\end{equation}

We decompose $\vec{k}$ into components $k_{\parallel}$ and $\vec{k}_{\perp}$, which are parallel and perpendicular to the line of sight, respectively. In the flat sky approximation, we can assume $k_{\perp}=\frac{\vec{l}}{\chi_*}$, where $l$ is the fourier conjugate of $\theta$. The $k_\parallel$ modes to which we are sensitive in the box are set by the redshift range of a single cube.\\

We consider now the 21 cm momentum field for which we have a similar expression.

\begin{equation}
p_{21}(\vec{\theta})=-\frac{1}{c}\hat{\theta}.\vec{q}_{21}(\chi_* \vec{\theta},\chi)
\end{equation}

with $\vec{q}_{21}(\vec{x})=\vec{v}_{21}(\vec{x}) \delta_{21} (\vec{x})$. Taking the Fourier transform gives

\begin{equation}
p_{21}(\vec{l},z)=\frac{-1}{c}\int \frac{dk_{\parallel}}{2\pi}\frac{e^{ik_{\parallel} \chi(z)}}{\chi(z)^2} \hat{\theta}.\vec{q}_{21}(k_\perp,k_\parallel,z)
\end{equation}\\

with $\vec{q}_{21}(k_\perp,k_\parallel,z)=\int \frac{d^3k'}{(2\pi)^3}\delta_{21}(\vec{k}-\vec{k}',z)\vec{v}_{21}(\vec{k}',z)$. A vector diagram of the momentum, density and velocity fields is shown in Figure \ref{fig:kvecdiagramnonlimber3d}.
We compute a window function for the 21 cm signal over which the signal is integrated. The redshift limits for the window function are set by the width of the cube. This eiminates any signal contribution from outside the limits of the cube. When computing the bispectrum, we take the small sky approximation. This is valid as there is very low contribution to the signal at low $l$ and the bispectrum signal peaks at large $l \approx 2000$. Thus, we consider only the 21 cm and kSZ fields in the same line of sight, i.e. the fields have an angular separation in the transverse direction, with equal line of sight contributions.

The line of sight direction is taken to be $r$.}

\subsubsection{Bispectrum signal}

We then compute the bispectrum as follows.

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
B^{p_{21}p_{ksz}}(\textbf{l}_{21},y_{21},z_{21})&=\int \frac{d^2\textbf{l}_{ksz}}{(2\pi)^2}\left<p_{21}(\textbf{l}_{21},y_{21},z_{21})p^*_{ksz}(\textbf{l}_{ksz})\right>\\
&=\frac{T_{rad}}{c^2}\frac{D^2(z_{21})}{\chi^2(z_{21}) r(z_{21})}\int \frac{d^2\textbf{l}_{ksz}}{(2\pi)^2} \int d\chi_{ksz}  {g}(\chi_{ksz})D^2(z_{ksz}) \int \frac{dk_{ksz}^{\parallel}}{2\pi}\frac{e^{-ik_{ksz}^{\parallel}} \chi_{ksz}}{\chi^2_{ksz}} \\ 
& \int \frac{d^3\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}}{(2\pi)^3}\int\frac{d^3\textbf{k}_{v_{ksz}}}{(2\pi)^3} <\delta_{21}(\textbf{k}_{q_{21}}-\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}){v}_{21}^{\parallel}(\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}) \delta^*_{ksz}(\textbf{k}_{q_{ksz}}-\textbf{k}_{v_{ksz}}){v}^{*\parallel}_{ksz}(\textbf{k}_{v_{ksz}})> \\
%=&\frac{T_{rad}}{c^2}\frac{D^2(z_{21})}{\chi^2(z_{21}) r(z_{21})}\int \frac{d^2\textbf{l}_{ksz}}{(2\pi)^2} \int d\chi_{ksz}  {g}(\chi_{ksz})D^2(z_{ksz}) \int \frac{dk_{ksz}^{\parallel}}{2\pi}\frac{e^{-ik_{ksz}^{\parallel}} \chi_{ksz}}{\chi^2_{ksz}} \\ 
%& \int \frac{d^3\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}}{(2\pi)^3}\int\frac{d^3\textbf{k}_{v_{ksz}}}{(2\pi)^3} \\
%&=-\frac{T_{rad}}{c^2}\frac{\bar{T}(z_i)D(z_i)(b+f\mu_k^2)}{\chi^2(z_i)r_\nu(z_i)}\left(\frac{a(z_i)\dot{D}(z_i)D(z_i)}{2{D_0}^2}\right)\int \frac{d^2k_{2\perp}}{(2\pi)^2} \int d\chi \chi^2 \widetilde {g}(\chi) \left(\frac{a(\chi)\dot{D}(\chi)D(\chi)}{2{D_0}^2}\right)\\ 
%&\int \frac{dk_{\parallel}}{2\pi}\frac{e^{ik_{\parallel} \chi_i}}{\chi_i^2}\int \frac{dk_{2\parallel}}{2\pi}e^{-ik_{2\parallel} \chi}\int \frac{d^2k'_\perp}{(2\pi)^2}\frac{dk'_\parallel}{2\pi}
%\int \frac{d^2k''_\perp}{(2\pi)^2}\frac{dk''_\parallel}{2\pi} \left<\delta_0(\vec{k}')\delta_0(\vec{k}-\vec{k}')  \delta_0^*(\vec{k}'')\delta_0^*(\vec{k_2}-\vec{k}'')\right>\\
%&\hat{\theta}.\left[\frac{\vec{k}-\vec{k'}}{|\vec{k}-\vec{k}'|^2}+\frac{\vec{k}'}{|\vec{k}'|^2}\right]\hat{\theta}.\left[\frac{\vec{k_2}-\vec{k}''}{|\vec{k_2}-\vec{k}''|^2}+\frac{\vec{k}''}{|\vec{k}''|^2}\right]
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Now, using Wick's theorem for gaussian fields gives us

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&<\delta_{21}(\textbf{k}_{q_{21}}-\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}){v}_{21}^{\parallel}(\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}) \delta^*_{ksz}(\textbf{k}_{q_{ksz}}-\textbf{k}_{v_{ksz}}){v}^{*\parallel}_{ksz}(\textbf{k}_{v_{ksz}})>\\
&=
(2\pi)^6 (P_{\delta_{21} \delta_{ksz}}(|\textbf{k}_{q_{21}}-\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}|) P_{v_{21}^\parallel v_{ksz}^\parallel}(k_{v_{21}})\delta^3(\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}-\textbf{k}_{v_{ksz}})\delta^3(\textbf{k}_{q_{21}}-\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}-\textbf{k}_{q_{ksz}}+\textbf{k}_{v_{ksz}})\\
&+P_{\delta_{21} v_{ksz}^\parallel}(|\textbf{k}_{q_{21}}-\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}|)P_{\delta_{ksz} v_{21}^\parallel}({v_{21}})\delta^3(\textbf{k}_{q_{21}}-\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}-\textbf{k}_{v_{ksz}})\delta^3(\textbf{k}_{q_{ksz}}-\textbf{k}_{v_{ksz}}-\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}))
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

We collapse the integrals. Looking at the first term, we set $\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}=\textbf{k}_{v_{ksz}}$ and $\textbf{k}_{{21}}=\textbf{k}_{q_{ksz}}$. The second term allows us to set $\textbf{k}_{v_{ksz}}=\textbf{k}_{{21}}-\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}$ and again that leaves $\textbf{k}_{{21}}=\textbf{k}_{q_{ksz}}$.

This gives the simplified expression for the bispectrum

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
B^{p_{21}p_e}(\textbf{l}_{21},y_{21},z_{21})=&\frac{T_{rad}}{8\pi^3c^2}\frac{D^2(z_{21})}{\chi^2(z_{21}) r(z_{21})} F(\textbf{k}_{q_{21}})
\int d\chi_{ksz} g(\chi_{ksz}) D^2(z_{ksz}) e^{-ik_{21}^\parallel \chi_{ksz}}\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where we define 

\begin{equation}
F(\textbf{k}_{q_{21}})=\int d^3\textbf{k}_{v_{21}} P_{\delta_{21} \delta_{ksz}}(k_{\delta_{21}}) P_{v_{21} v_{ksz}}(k_{v_{21}})+P_{\delta_{21} v_{ksz}}(k_{\delta_{21}}) P_{v_{21} \delta_{ksz}}(k_{v_{21}})
\end{equation}

with the vector $\textbf{k}_{q_{21}}=(k_{21}^{\parallel},k_{21}^{\perp})=\left(\frac{y}{r(z_{21})},\frac{l}{\chi(z_{21})}\right)$.\\

The full expression with the integral over redshift is then

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
B^{p_{21}p_e}(\vec{l},y_{21})&=\frac{T_{rad}x}{4\pi^2 c}\frac{\sigma_T \rho_{g0}}{\mu_e m_p}\int_{z_{min}}^{z_{max}} d z_{21}\frac{\bar{T}^2(z_{21})rsd^2f(z_{21})D(z_{21})^2 H(z_{21}) }{\chi^2(z_{21})r(z_{21})(1+z_{21})} G(k_{21}^\parallel,k_{21}^\perp)F(k_{21}^\parallel)\\
%&=\frac{T_{rad}x}{4\pi^2 c^2}\frac{\sigma_T \rho_{g0}}{\mu_e m_p}\int d \chi_{21}\frac{\bar{T}^2(z_{21})rsd^2f(z_{21})D^2(z_{21}) H^2(z_{21}) }{\chi^2(z_{21})r(z_{21})(1+z_{21})} G(k_{21}^\parallel,k_{21}^\perp)F(k_{21}^\parallel)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where we define

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{equation}
	F(k_{21}^\parallel)=\int_{\chi(z_{ksz}=0)}^{\chi(z_{ksz}=10)} d\chi_{kSZ} F(\chi_{kSZ}) e^{-ik_{21}^\parallel \chi_{kSZ}}
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
	F(\chi_{kSZ})=\frac{1}{c}f (z_{kSZ}) D^2(z_{kSZ})(1+z_{kSZ})H(z_{kSZ})e^{-\tau(z_{kSZ})}
	\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

and 

\begin{equation}
G(k_{21}^\parallel,k_{21}^\perp)=\int d k_{v_{21}}^{\perp} \int dk_{v_{21}}^{\parallel} k_{v_{21}}^{\perp} P_{\delta_{m} \delta_m}(k_{v_{21}}) P_{\delta_{m} \delta_m}(k_{\delta_{21}})\left( \frac{\mu^2_{k_{v_{21}}}}{k^2_{v_{21}}}+\frac{\mu_{k_{v_{21}}} \mu_{k_{\delta_{21}}}}{k_{v_{21}} k_{\delta_{21}}} \right)
\end{equation}


which uses the dimensionless quantity $\mu_{k}=\frac{k^\parallel}{k}$.


We plot $F(\chi_{kSZ})$ in Figure \ref{fig:fchikszfull} and the fourier transform, $F(k_{21}^\parallel)$ in Figure \ref{fig:fkparfullrelevantkparscales}. The bispectrum signal is plotted thereafter

\subsection{Noise}


We previously had the true integrated bispectrum signal written as 

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
B^{p_{21}p_e}(l_{q_{21}},y_{21})&=\int \frac{d^2\textbf{l}_{ksz}}{(2\pi)^2}\left<p_{21}(\textbf{l}_{21},y_{21}, z_{21})p^*_{ksz}(\textbf{l}_{ksz})\right>\\
&=\frac{-T_{rad}}{c}\int \frac{d^2\textbf{l}_{ksz}}{(2\pi)^2}\int dz_{21} \frac{1}{\chi(z_{21})^2 r(z_{21})} D^2(z_{21})\int \frac{d^3\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}}{(2\pi)^3}\left< \delta_{21} (\textbf{k}_{\delta_{21}}) v^\parallel_{21} (\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}) p_{ksz}(\textbf{l}_{ksz})\right>\\
&=\int \frac{d^2l_{ksz}}{(2\pi)^2} \int dz_{21} \int \frac{d^3\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}}{(2\pi)^3} C(z_{21}) \left< \delta_{21} (\textbf{k}_{\delta_{21}}) v^\parallel_{21} (\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}) p_{ksz}(\textbf{l}_{ksz})\right>
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where we have defined $C(z_{21})=\frac{-T_{rad}}{c}\frac{1}{\chi(z_{21})^2 r(z_{21})} D^2(z_{21})$.

We can also write the full bispectrum as 

\begin{equation}
B(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}},z_{21},\textbf{k}_{v_{21}},\textbf{l}_{ksz})=C(z_{21}) \left< \delta_{21} (\textbf{k}_{\delta_{21}}) v^\parallel_{21} (\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}) p_{ksz}(\textbf{l}_{ksz})\right>
\end{equation}

We now define an optimal bispectrum estimator, 

\begin{equation}
\hat{B}_l(y)=B_l(y) \hat{\epsilon}(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}})
\end{equation}

with

\begin{equation}
\hat{\epsilon}(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}})=\frac{1}{N(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}})}\int \frac{d^2\textbf{l}_{ksz}}{(2\pi)^2}\int d z_{21} \int \frac{d^3 \textbf{k}_{v_{21}}}{(2\pi)^3} C(z_{21}) \hat{f}(\textbf{k}_{q_{21}},\textbf{k}_{v_{21}},\textbf{l}_{ksz}) W(\textbf{k}_{q_{21}},\textbf{k}_{v_{21}},\textbf{l}_{ksz},z_{21})
\end{equation}

where $\hat{f}(\textbf{k}_{q_{21}},\textbf{k}_{v_{21}},\textbf{l}_{ksz})=\hat{\delta}(\textbf{k}_{\delta_{21}})\hat{v}^\parallel_{21} (\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}) \hat{p}_{ksz}(\textbf{l}_{ksz})$.

The normalisation for the estimator is written such that $\left< \hat{\epsilon}(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}})\right>=1$. This gives us the expression

\begin{equation}

&  C^{p_{21},tot}(k_{q_{21}},k_{v_{21}},z_{21}) C^{p_{ksz}}_l\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where 
$C^{p_{21},tot}(k_{q_{21}},k_{v_{21}},z_{21})= \int d z'_{21} C(z_{21}) C(z'_{21}) [P^{tot}_{\delta_{21}\delta_{21}}(k_{\delta_{21}})P^{tot}_{v_{21}v_{21}}(k_{v_{21}})+P^{tot}_{\delta_{21}v_{21}}(k_{\delta_{21}})P^{tot}_{\delta_{21} v_{21}}(k_{v_{21}})]$.

Minimizing the variance gives the optimal weighting of 

\begin{equation}
W(\textbf{k}_{q_{21}},\textbf{k}_{v_{21}},\textbf{l}_{ksz},z_{21})=\frac{ B(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}},z_{21},\textbf{k}_{v_{21}},\textbf{l}_{ksz})}{C^{p_{21},tot}(k_{q_{21}},k_{v_{21}},z_{21})C^{p_{ksz}}_l}
\end{equation}
Substituting this to get the expression for the normalization gives

\begin{equation}
N(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}})=\int \frac{d^2 l_{ksz}}{(2\pi)^2}  \int d z_{21} \int \frac{d^3 \textbf{k}_{v_{21}}}{(2\pi)^3}  \frac{|B(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}},z_{21},\textbf{k}_{v_{21}},\textbf{l}_{ksz})|^2}{C^{p_{21},tot}(k_{q_{21}},k_{v_{21}},z_{21})C^{p_{ksz}}_l}=Var[\hat{\epsilon}(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}})]
\end{equation}

after which we can write

\begin{equation}
Var[\hat{B}(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}})]=B_l(y) Var[\hat{\epsilon}(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}})]
\end{equation}

The signal to noise ratio is then 




\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{S}{N}(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}})\right)^2=\frac{V}{2}\int \frac{d^2 l_{ksz}}{(2\pi)^2} \int d z_{21} \int \frac{d^3 \textbf{k}_{v_{21}}}{(2\pi)^3}\frac{|B(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}},z_{21},\textbf{k}_{v_{21}},\textbf{l}_{ksz})|^2}{C^{p_{21},tot}(k_{q_{21}},k_{v_{21}},z_{21})C^{p_{ksz},tot}(\textbf{l}_{ksz})}
\end{equation}


We use the triangle condition for the bispectrum, $\delta^3(\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}+\textbf{k}_{\delta_{21}}-\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}+\textbf{l}_{ksz}/\chi)=0$ to set $\textbf{l}_{21}=\textbf{l}_{ksz}$ which simplifies our expression to


\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{S}{N}(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}})\right)^2= \frac{V}{2C_l^{p_{ksz},tot}}\int d z_{21} \int \frac{d^3 \textbf{k}_{v_{21}}}{(2\pi)^3}\frac{|B(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}},z_{21},\textbf{k}_{v_{21}},\textbf{l}_{ksz})|^2}{C^{p_{21},tot}(k_{q_{21}},k_{v_{21}},z_{21})}
\end{equation}

where we substitute

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
B^{p_{21}p_e}(\textbf{l}_{21},y_{21},\textbf{k}_{v_{21}}, z_{21})=&\frac{T_{rad}}{8\pi^3c^2}\frac{D^2(z_{21})}{\chi^2(z_{21}) r(z_{21})} F(\textbf{k}_{q_{21}}, \textbf{k}_{v_{21}})
\int d\chi_{ksz} g(\chi_{ksz}) D^2(z_{ksz}) e^{-ik_{21}^\parallel \chi_{ksz}}\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where we define 

\begin{equation}
F(\textbf{k}_{q_{21}}, \textbf{k}_{v_{21}})= P_{\delta_{21} \delta_{ksz}}(k_{\delta_{21}}) P_{v_{21} v_{ksz}}(k_{v_{21}})+P_{\delta_{21} v_{ksz}}(k_{\delta_{21}}) P_{v_{21} \delta_{ksz}}(k_{v_{21}})
\end{equation}

We integrate the $\frac{S}{N}(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}})$ over $l$ and $y$ as follows

\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{S}{N}\right)^2=\frac{V}{2}\int \frac{dl_{21}}{2\pi} \int \frac{dy_{21}}{2\pi} l_{21} \left(\frac{S}{N}(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}})\right)^2
\end{equation}

We plot the signal to noise without integrating over the 21 cm redshift bin in Figure \ref{fig:optimalsn2dbispecz1pt26deltazpt003kpmax1}. We also plot the signal, $B(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}})$ in figure \ref{fig:2dbispecz1pt26deltazpt003kpmax1} and standard deviation, $\sigma (\hat{B}(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}}))$ in figure \ref{fig:2dinvvarz1pt26deltazpt003kpmax1}, in order to check the results obtained for the signal to noise, with the $\sigma (\hat{B}(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}}))$ is expressed as 

\begin{equation}
\sigma (\hat{B}(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}}))=Var(\hat{B}(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}}))^{1/2}=\left[\int \frac{d^3k'}{(2\pi)^3} \frac{1}{C^{p_{21},tot}(l_{q_{21}},y_{q_{21}},k')C_l^{p_{ksz},tot}}\right]^{-1/2}
\end{equation}

$const=\frac{N_{patches} f_{sky} Volume}{(4\pi)^2}$. I use the following equations

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{equation}
	N_{patches}=\frac{S_{area}}{FOV}
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
	Volume=S_{area} \Delta \tilde{\nu}
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
	f_{sky}=\frac{S_{area}}{2\pi}
	\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

with $S_{area}=15000$ square degrees.

\section{Calibration}

\subsection{Redundant baseline calibration}

In order to study the sky, we must build telescopes. Unfortunately, the telescopes used to measure the sky also introduce systematics that inhibit complete recovery of the sky signal. These effects of these systematics are determined by the telescope calibration. Let's consider a true sky signal which we hope to measure and which we will call $x_i$, where $i$ is the antenna index. The signal which we measure with the antenna is then written in terms of the complex gain factor, $g_i$, and the instrumental noise, $n_i$ [Liu, 2010]. 

Thus, we have the equation 

\begin{equation}\label{measured and true signal one antenna}
s_i = g_i x_i + n_i
\end{equation}

For a radio interferometer, discussed earlier in Chapter 2, we of course have different baselines, each of which measures the correlation between two signals from the two respective antennae. This gives the relation between the visibilities which we measure with the radio interferometer, and the true visibilities.

\begin{equation}\label{measured vis eqn}
\begin{aligned}
c_{ij} & = \left< s_i s_j \right>\\
& = g^*_i g_j \left< x^*_i x_j \right> + g^*_i \left< x^*_i n_j \right> + g_j \left< x_j n^*_i \right> + \left< n^*_i n_j \right> \\
& = g^*_i g_j y_{i-j} + n_{ij}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where we have combined the last three terms in the second line and set this equal to the noise level which we label as $n_{ij}$. The value for this noise is dependent on the instrument; more specifically on the system temperature, $T_{sys}$, integration time, $\tau$ and frequency bandwidth, $\Delta \nu$. Thus, the noise can be estimated as being on the order of $T_{sys}/\sqrt{\tau \Delta \nu}$. We have also expressed the correlation of two sky signals as $y_{i-j}$, which is the true visibilities. The notation for the true sky visibilities is chosen to signify that these visibilities depend only on the relative difference between two antenna positions. Hence, redundant baselines will measure the true visibility. This is the foundation on which redundant calibration is based, as we will see shortly. The measured visibilities, of course, will be different for each baseline, due to the different noise and complex antenna gains of each antenna. \\
Now, the complex gains can be separated into a gain amplitude, $\eta_i$ and a gain phase, $\phi_i$ for a single antenna, thus giving two gain parameters for each antenna. We can write the gains as $g_i = e^{\eta_i + i \phi_i}$. \\
If we were to attempt true visibilities from the measured visibilities without using the redundancy of baselines, we would have an unsolvable equation. This can be seen if we consider an N number of antennae, giving $N(N-1)/2$ measured visibilities, which we cannot use to solve for the same number of true visibilities plus the 2N gain parameters. The noise is not a quantity for which we solve, but is instead a systematic effect which we try to minimize. Note that we have excluded auto-correlations i.e. the correlation of a dish with itself. Including these would the number of visibilities to $N(N-1)/2 +N$. The reason that we choose to omit them is that they contain correlated noise which tends to be higher than other measurements. \\
 Now, if we instead use the redundancy of the telescope baselines, we reduce our number of unknowns for which we must solve. Thus, we instead have the number of true visibilities equal to the number of unique baselines. This will depend on the number of arrays and their layout. For dishes arranged in the north-south and east-west direction, we find that the minimum size array, which can be used to solve the set of equations, is a $2 \times 3$ array. For such an array, we have 30 knowns (obtained from the real and imaginary components of the 15 measured visibilities) which are used to solve for 6 $\eta$'s and 6 $\phi$'s, as well as 14 values from the true visibilities of 7 unique baselines. The unique baselines are shown on the diagram and are chosen with the assumption that the north-east and south-west baselines do not see the same sky signal, i.e. we assume an asymmetric sky. Altogether, 30 knowns are used to solve for 26 unknowns. Using the diagram, we can write out the equations as 
 
 \begin{subequations}
 \begin{equation*}
c_{1,2} = exp [(\eta_1 + \eta_2) + i(\phi_2 - \phi_1)] y_1 + n_{1,2}
\end{equation*}
 \begin{equation*}
c_{2,3} = exp [(\eta_2 + \eta_3) + i(\phi_3 - \phi_2)] y_1 + n_{2,3}
\end{equation*}
($c_{45}$ and $c_{56}$ the same baseline of 1 with true visibility $y_1$)
 \begin{equation*}
c_{1,3} = exp [(\eta_1 + \eta_3) + i(\phi_3 - \phi_1)] y_2 + n_{1,3}
\end{equation*}
($c_{46}$ has the same baseline of 2 with true visibility $y_2$)
 \begin{equation*}
c_{1,4} = exp [(\eta_1 + \eta_4) + i(\phi_4 - \phi_1)] y_3 + n_{1,4}
\end{equation*}
($c_{25}$ and $c_{36}$ the same baseline of 2 with true visibility $y_3$)
 \begin{equation*}
c_{1,5} = exp [(\eta_1 + \eta_5) + i(\phi_5 - \phi_1)] y_{\sqrt{10}, NE} + n_{1,5}
\end{equation*}
($c_{26}$ has the same NE baseline of ${\sqrt{10}}$  with true visibility $y_{\sqrt{10}, NE}$)
\begin{equation*}
c_{2,4} = exp [(\eta_2 + \eta_4) + i(\phi_4 - \phi_2)] y_{\sqrt{10},SW} + n_{2,4}
\end{equation*}
($c_{35}$ has the same SW baseline of ${\sqrt{10}}$ with true visibility $y_{\sqrt{10}, SW}$)
\begin{equation*}
c_{1,6} = exp [(\eta_1 + \eta_6) + i(\phi_6 - \phi_1)] y_{\sqrt{13},NE} + n_{1,6}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
c_{3,4} = exp [(\eta_3 + \eta_4) + i(\phi_4 - \phi_3)] y_{\sqrt{13},SW} + n_{3,4}
\end{equation*}
 \end{subequations}\\

\subsubsection{Logarithmic Calibration}

The set of equations can be treated as a linear system if we take the log of each side. We can rewrite equation \ref{measured vis eqn} as 

\begin{equation}
c_{ij} = g^*_i g_j y_{i-j} \left( 1 + \frac{n_{ij}}{ g^*_i g_j y_{i-j}} \right)
\end{equation}

where $ g^*_i g_j = exp[(\eta_i + \eta_j +i(\phi_j - \phi_i))]$

Taking the log of each side then gives

\begin{equation}
In c_{ij} = \eta_i + \eta_j +i(\phi_j - \phi_i) + In y_{i-j} + w_{ij}
\end{equation}

where $w_{ij} = In\left( 1 + \frac{n_{ij}}{ g^*_i g_j y_{i-j}} \right)$. We can then separate the real and imaginary parts of the equation. This means that the real true sky and the gain amplitude are solved for separately from the imaginary true sky and gain phase. The two equations are

\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}\label{amplitude calibration}
In |c_{ij}| = \eta_i + \eta_j + In |y_{i-j}| + Re w_{i,j}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
arg|c_{ij}| = i(\phi_j - \phi_i) + arg |y_{i-j}| + Im w_{i,j}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

The amplitude calibration, in equation \ref{amplitude calibration},  is written in matrix form, \textbf{d} = \textbf{A x} + Re\textbf{w}, where \textbf{d} are the known measured visibilities, \textbf{A} is the array configuration matrix, \textbf{x} is the matrix of unknown which consists of the gain amplitude and unique baselines. These matrices are given as follows

\begin{equation}\label{least sq eqn with dAx}
\setcounter{MaxMatrixCols}{13}
\begin{pmatrix} In |c_{1,2}|  \\ In |c_{2,3}|\\ In |c_{4,5}|\\In |c_{5,6}|\\In |c_{1,3}|\\

\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}\\


This set of equations has no unique solution, even in the noiseless case (in which we assume that each antenna has negligible noise, i.e. $w_{ij}=0$ for all $i,j$). This degeneracy can be understood quite simply if we refer to equation \ref{measured and true signal one antenna}. For a single antenna, if we were to multiply the gain by a factor, $\alpha$, and divide the true sky signal by the same factor, the signal measured by the antenna will remain the same. This degeneracy is broken by constraining the sum of the gain amplitudes. We have the same constraint requirement for the phase calibration. However, there are two additional constraints required for phase calibration. If we were to rotate the sky clockwise by a degree, $\phi_{rot}$, and rotate the antennae by the same degree anti-clockwise, the gain phase would be the same. We thus constraint the product of the phase and antenna position, for both x and y positions. This gives 3 constraints in total for the phase calibration and 1 for the amplitude calibration. 

The least squares equation is then used to solve for the set of equations, presented here in its familiar form\\
 \textbf{x} = [\textbf{A}$^t$ \textbf{N}$^{-1}$ \textbf{A}]$^{-1}$ \textbf{A}$^t$ \textbf{N}$^{-1}$ \textbf{d}

where the noise covariance matrix is expressed as $\textbf{N} = \left< Re \textbf{w} Re \textbf{w}^t \right>$ for the amplitude calibration, with the imaginary components taking the same form for the phase calibration. The constraints required to break degeneracies are then added as extra rows in the \textbf{A},\textbf{N} and \textbf{d} matrices. We maintain diagonality of the noise matrix when adding the constraints, and simply set the last value of the matrix to be \textbf{N}[-1][-1]=1 for the amplitude calibration, in order to weight the constraint. \\

Let us now look at the noise covariance matrix in a bit more detail. In the redundant calibration method put forth by Wieringa, 1992, the noise covariance matrix as set to the identity. However, in Liu et al, 2010, it is argued that using an inverse variance weighting provides a more optimal solution for the calibration. The noise covariance matrix is then chosen to be a diagonal matrix, since we are assuming uncorrelated noise between different baselines, with the diagonal components equal to [Liu et al, 2010]

\begin{equation}
N_{\alpha \alpha} = \frac{\sigma^2}{|c_\alpha|^2}
\end{equation}


where we have assumed gaussian noise with spread, $\sigma$. Notice the changed notation for the measured visibilities in this equation, since we have used the subscript, $\alpha$, to denote each baseline. We can then assign $\alpha=1$ to the baseline formed between antennae $i=1,j=2$, and so on for each measured visibility described in the set of equations. We will consider both the cases of a weighted noise covariance matrix and an identity matrix, depending on which is more suitable. We will return to this a bit later on. For now though, let us consider the noiseless case for the amplitude calibration in order to be certain that we obtain perfect gain recovery and that the degeneracies are well broken. Although the equations thus far have been designed for the $ 2 \times 3$ array described in the diagram, we will consider larger arrays due to the reduced calibration error that arises from increasing the size of the array. For a $5 \times 5$ array, the recovered gain amplitudes were plotted against simulated gain amplitudes.

Now, let us consider an array of the same size with gaussian noise, as described previously. Unless otherwise stated, it is assumed that the arrays used have a system temperature of $T_{sys} = 50 K$, and a channel width of 390 kHz (obtained using the 400 MHz bandwidth of HIRAX with 1024 frequency channels) and an integration time of $\tau = 10 s$. We will investigate the effect that antenna noise and gain fluctuations have on the recovered gain errors.\\

The least squares error is computed as the two dimensional matrix,

\begin{equation}\label{least sq eqn}
\mathbf{\Sigma} = [\textbf{A}^t \textbf{N}^{-1} \textbf{A}]^{-1}
\end{equation}

with the errors for each antenna equal to the square root of the diagonal of $\mathbf{\Sigma}$. The quantity $diag(\mathbf{\Sigma})^{1/2}$, contains the errors for all unknowns, for which we are solving, i.e. both the gains and true visibilities. We quote only the gain errors here.

 First, we will assume no gain fluctuations, and compute the least squares error for two different antenna noise levels. Thus, we can deduce the effect that lowering system temperature will have on our ability to recover gains.

The plots show two separate noise levels, averaged over 10 realisations, with the left and right plots assuming antenna system temperatures of $T_{sys}=5 K$ and $T_{sys}=50 K$, respectively. As seen, the noise makes a significant difference to gain errors. We also notice the symmetry of the errors which is due to the baseline redundancy, although the error differences are small.}

\end{figure}

A factor of ten increase in the noise level gives a corresponding increase in the gain error. The dependence of the gain error on antenna location is symmetric due to the different baselines to which the antennae contribute. The centrally located antennae contribute to a larger number of redundant baselines, as compared to those antennae that are placed on the outskirts. As a result, the edge placed antennae have a higher calibration error. The gain errors obtained with logarithmic calibration has been investigated in papers such as Liu et al 2010 and Dillon 2016, and we see the same pattern for calibration errors. The difference is that Liu computed the errors for different realisations of a gaussian sky, whereas we have considered only different realisations of antenna noise. Dillon has assumed a constant noise, which gives a slightly different variation in calibration errors, but we will come back to this in a bit. Of course, the colour scale of the plots informs us of the weak dependence that antenna location has on the calibration error. There is a higher dependence of gain error on the number of antennae in the array, assuming that the antennae are placed such that they increase baseline redundancy. If new antennae are added as outliers that form completely separate baselines, we do not expect this to reduce the calibration errors of the array. Thus, we explicitly investigate the variation of gain error with regular grid arrays by computing the least squares error for 3 arrays of sizes, $10 \times 10$, $15 \times 15$ and $16 \times 16$, with the 6 m dishes again placed edge to edge. Note that, because we are only comparing the least squares errors of arrays relative to each other, we need not optimize the gain residuals by computing the inverse variance weighting in the noise covariance matrix. Hence, we set the noise covariance matrix to be equal to identity. This reduces the time required to generate the simulated plots. Therefore, the scales on the plots in Figure \ref{fig:lstsq_error_10by10_15by15_16by16} should not be compared to that of figure \ref{fig:lstsq_error_5by5}. Equation \ref{least sq eqn} for the least squares error is reduced to the simplified $\mathbf{\Sigma} = [\textbf{A}^t \textbf{A}]^{-1}$.This simple expression cannot be evaluated by taking the direct inverse since \textbf{A} is never a square matrix and is therefore not invertible. This is true for any \textbf{A} matrix if we hope to find unique gain solutions. Thus, we rely on taking the pseudoinverse of $[\textbf{A}^t \textbf{A}]$ [Dillon, 2013]. Once again, we plot the square root of the diagonals of $\mathbf{\Sigma}$. Note that the dependence of these errors is only on the \textbf{A} matrix and is thus unaffected by the gain amplitude fluctuations. \\

We assume an identity noise when running these simulations and thus observe a higher gain error at the centre dishes. The difference in antennae gain error for a given array is small. We instead focus on the reduced gain error for larger arrays, which is expected for arrays with similar baseline redundancies.}
\label{fig:lstsq_error_10by10_15by15_16by16}
\end{figure}

The symmetry of the gain errors is similar to that of figure \ref{fig:lstsq_error_5by5} but we notice that the centre of the array has a larger error than the centre of the array. This is because the ring of antennae around the centre contribute to more redundant baselines than those situated at the absolute centre. This was not clear in the $5 \times 5$ array due to the weighting which was used. Dillon, 2016 has also assumed an identity noise matrix and obtained the same colour variation in his gain error plots. Once more, we notice from the scale that the the difference in error is small within each array layout. Thus, we turn our attention to the maximal errors for each array size. It is clear from the plots that larger arrays result in reduced gain errors. Liu showed that for antennae with similar baseline redundancies, we can expect error to scale as $\Delta \eta \propto 1/\sqrt{N}$. Thus, we expect a factor of $ \sim 1.5$ decrease in error between the $10 \times 10$ and $15 \times 15$, and a  corresponding $ \sim 1.6$ error reduction for the $16 \times 16$, which is what we obtain. 

Now, we mentioned that the gain error depends more on the baseline redundancy than the array size. For instance, if an array is increased by adding outlier dishes that do not contribute to the redundancy of the baselines, the maximum gain error may increase [Dillon, 2016]. We present simulations for 5 different array layouts in order to test calibratability. Further work on array layouts has been undertaken by the HIRAX collaboration and what is shown here is only a test of the effect that the array layouts may have on gain error. There are of course, many factors to consider when choosing a telescope array which is out of the scope of this thesis. When comparing the gain errors for the various arrays, we once more assume an identity noise covariance matrix, so that the errors depend only on \textbf{A}. We present four of the arrays considered by the HIRAX collaboration as an alternative to the square which was shown already in Figure \ref{fig:lstsq_error_10by10_15by15_16by16}. The hex grid and both subgrids all contain 256 dishes, and can thus be compared to the $16 \times 16$ square grid. The 243-dish hera grid plotted here is in fact a scaled down version of the full 331-dish hera layout presented in Dillion, 2016. We notice that all 5 layouts have the same order gain error of $\sim 0.06$, which assures us that there isn't a particular layout that is much less calibratable than any other. However, we can analyze the discrepancies in gain errors and compare these to the baseline redundancy plot in Figure \ref{fig:baselineredundancy5arrays} to find the layout with the optimal baseline-redundancy relation so that we can see the effect of this on the gain error. The two subgrids have the same baseline-redundancy dependence, with 1012 unique baselines and maximum redundancy of 224, and hence the exact same gain errors. The subgrids have more unique baselines than the hera, square and hex. However, these unique baselines have a reduced redundancy. As a result, the gain error for the subgrids is higher than any of the other layouts. With regards to the hex and square, we notice that the baseline-redundancy plot is very similar for both, but the square does have slightly fewer unique baselines which means an increased redundancy of baselines. The arrangement of antennae in the square grid is therefore better for gain calibration than the hex. The hera grid has slightly higher redundancy than all the other arrays, and more unique baselines than the square and hex. Hence, it has the best baseline-redundancy relation and as a result, has the lowest gain errors, despite having fewer dishes.

These four can be compared with the 256 dish square grid. The hex consists of 6 m dishes placed edge to edge, with every alternate row offset by 3 m so that a singular antenna has 6 antennae placed around it in a hex shape. The overall shape is not a symmetric hex, resulting in an asymmetric pattern in the gain errors. The HERA layout consists of two slanted squares and a separate diamond, that each contain 81 dishes, making up 243 dishes in total. Subgrid 1 has 8 blocks in x and y with 4 dishes in each block. Within each block, the dishes are placed edge-to-edge and between the blocks there is a 2 m gap between the edges of the dishes. Subgrid 2 instead has 2 blocks in x and y with 64 dishes in each block. Once more, the dishes within the block are placed edge-to-edge but we instead have a 3 m gap between the edges of the dishes in the separate blocks.}

\subsubsection{Linear calibration}
Logarithmic calibration allows us to simplify our equation into a simple linear least squares problem. Though it can provide quick tests for gain calibratability, Logcal is not very accurate due to a slight bias. Thus, linear calibration (Lincal) is commonly used instead, with the results from Logcal providing a good first guess for Lincal. We do not quote results using Lincal in this thesis but instead provide a brief overview of Lincal as motivation for implementing this in future work. Ali 2015 and Liu 2010 discuss improvements to redundant calibration as a result of using Lincal or Omnical, which is a combination of the two algorithms. Further motivation to use Lincal is provided in the next section.

\subsubsection{Problems with redundant calibration}

One of the drawbacks of redundant calibration, whether we use Logcal or Lincal, is that it assumes perfect redundancy and does not account for dish misalignments. To demonstrate the effect that an offset of as little as 10 cm could have on the gain errors, we introduce random offsets in the x and y positions of each antennae of up to 10 cm. For the $5 \times 5$ array, without gain fluctuations and with $50 K$ system temperature, we compute the mean and standard deviations of the relative gain errors for 100 runs. Note that the randomized dish scatter remains the same for each run and that only the noise and corresponding measured visibilities change for the different runs. We compare histograms of the relative error $\mu$ and $\sigma$ for the perfectly redundant case, that contains no dish scatter, and for the imperfect case with dish scatter. Note that the dish scatter will change the visibilities but we will compute the gain errors assuming a perfect grid, such that the \textbf{A} matrix does not change. In doing so, we find that introducing dish scatters that are on the order of 60 times smaller than the dish separation has roughly the same order increase on the gain errors. Thus, it is worth investigating a calibration algorithm that does not assume complete redundancy.
