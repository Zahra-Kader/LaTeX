\section{Introduction [2 pgs]}
-Justification for this paper, highlight uncertainties on when a gw will be detected using pulsars, the aims and objectives which are to find SNR for meerkat. Talk about meertime project. Layout of the paper and a small paragraph on each section listed below  
\section{Pulsars}
\subsection{Discovery and basic properties[2 pgs]}

What they are\\
How they are formed\\ 
History of pulsars and their discovery\\ 
Formation of millisecond pulsars\\
Hulse and Taylor %include mechanics of binary pulsars but leave out diagram on mechanics of binary pulsars in paper

\subsection{Basics of pulsar timing[4 pgs]}
3 things that affect TOA-effects at pulsar, between pulsar and earth, and at earth\\
Barycentric and dispersion corrections-including pulse profiles and coherent dedispersion\\
Isolated pulsar timing model
%-move part from blandford paper on the timing model with 8 terms to here and try to get the graph for errors in proper motion
\section{Gravitational Waves}
\subsection{Properties of gravitational waves [3]}
Explain that GWs have a quadrupole nature that are produced as a result of the acceleration of non-spherically symmetric mass distributions\\
GW has plus and cross polarisations
\subsection{Gravitational wave sources[2]}
Black hole mergers
Primordial GWs
\section{Linear least squares fitting to compute residuals [2]}
Deriving the equation for the mean residual squared equal to the sum of the filter function multiplied by the autocorrelation function of the noise
\section{Analysis of timing residuals for gravitational waves[5]}
Transfer functions for the timing model with 8 fitting functions\\
Rewriting residuals in terms of frequency and giving the power spectrum of the GWs 
\section{Detectibility of Gravitational Waves[8]}
Radiometer noise from radio telescopes and finding the white noise for effelsberg and meerkat\\
Red noise\\ 
Calculating SNR 
\section{Pulsar Timing Arrays[1]}
Array of pulsars in different directions on the sky, a GW will affect all pulse TOAs. Can be certain that timing residuals are due to GW 
Increases SNR by square root N
New SNR values using pulsar number proposed for meertime\\
\section{Conclusion[1/2]}
