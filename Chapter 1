Space and time began as a singularity 13.8 billion years ago in an event which Fred Hoyle mockingly referred to as the 'Big Bang'. A period of inflation is believed to have occurred thereafter, and though it lasted for a short time, infinitesimal perturbations were able to expand \cite{Guth:1980zm}. It is these perturbations that allowed for large scale structures (LSS's) to form in present time. The hot and dense state of the universe at this time resulted in a 'cosmic soup' of particles, whose energy was reduced with the expansion and cooling of the universe. Subatomic particles, called quarks, combined to form protons and neutrons, which were coupled with the photons through Compton scattering, while the electrons were coupled to the baryons through Coloumbic forces. Around 380 000 years after the Big Bang, the Epoch of Recombination allowed for the combining of electrons and protons to form neutral Hydrogen. The photons were then free to travel in the neutral universe. This free streaming of photons in the early universe from the surface of last scattering is referred to as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) due to the stretching of the light into micro wavelengths by the time it reached us.\\
The primordial perturbations, which were stretched through the process of inflation, allowed for the growth and eventual collapse of large clumps of matter. This was due to the gravitational attraction of matter in overdense regions. As a result of this collapse of clouds of gas, the first stars were born and the universe, which had remained neutral since recombination, was once more reionized in a period referred to as the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The formation of the first stars resulted in UV radiation reionizing neutral atoms. The inner regions of large scale structures (LSS's) were protected from this UV radiation and thus maintained a fraction of its neutrality. \\
The observable matter making up stars, galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM) was studied for a long time, during which it was assumed that the universe was composed only of baryonic matter that interacted with radiation. Studying the velocity dispersion of the Coma Cluster, however, led scientists to the conclusion that there was matter which could not be observed and hence does not interact with light. This mysterious matter is referred to as 'dark matter' \cite{1937ApJ....86..217Z}. Further observations lent credence to this hypothesis, such as the rotation curves of galaxies \cite{1970ApJ...159..379R} and constraints from CMB observations; the most recent of which from Planck have suggested that baryonic matter makes up $\sim 4.86\%$ while dark matter makes up $\sim 26.64 \%$ \cite{2019arXiv190602552P}. In this thesis we account for dark matter with the use of the cold dark matter (CDM) power spectrum.\\
Another observation made by Hubble in the early 20th century changed the common perception that the universe was static. He observed that galaxies were receding away from each other and from us. Once it was established that the universe was expanding, it was still theorized that the expansion was slowing down. It was only in the late 20th century that observations by astronomers provided evidence of an accelerated expansion in the universe. This was obtained through the observation of Type Ia supernovae  \cite{Riess_1998}\cite{Perlmutter_1999}. The expansion is accounted for in Einstein's General Relativity (GR) with a cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, which represents a form of energy which we refer to as 'dark energy'. Dark energy is thought to be the driving force of the universe's expansion. Throughout this thesis, we use the $\Lambda CDM$ model, which assumes that dark energy maintains a constant energy density as the universe expands.\\ 
We have given a very brief account of the 13.8 billion years that have passed since time began. Let us now return to the CMB and discuss its use in aiding our study of the evolution of the universe. We can use the CMB to obtain insight into the universe since various gravitational and scattering effects introduce characteristic temperature fluctuations in the CMB spectrum. Effects which occurred at the surface of last scattering are primary anisotropies, while those that occur between last scattering and today induce secondary CMB anisotropies. Thus, studying the CMB furthers our understanding of both the early and late universe. Some examples of primary gravitational anisotropies are the gravitational redshifting of photons at recombination, known as the Sachs Wolfe (SW) effect, as well as the change in gravitational potential as the universe transitions from radiation to matter domination. This is referred to as the early integrated Sachs Wolfe (ISW) effect. Gravitational lensing is a widely studied phenomenon caused by the deflection of CMB photons as they pass large structures while traveling to Earth. The late time ISW effect is a result of the change in gravitational potential when the universe transitions from matter domination to dark energy domination. The extension of the ISW into non-linear scales is referred to as the Rees-Sciama (RS) effect and is required to account for fluctuations once they leave the linear regime \cite{1968Natur.217..511R}. We will be focusing on secondary scattering effects in this thesis; specifically the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect \cite{Sunyaev:1972eq} \cite{Sunyaev:1980nv}, which is a result of CMB photons inverse Compton scattered off ionized elecrons. The thermal SZ (tSZ) is the spectral distortion of the CMB as a result of photons gaining energy from interactions with the hot gas in the intra-cluster medium (ICM). The kSZ is smaller than the tSZ and is caused by the doppler shifting of CMB photons as they pass through moving clusters. Measurements of the kSZ are thus useful for studying the velocity field of galaxies \cite{2012AfrSk..16..147Z} \cite{Keisler_2013} \cite{2018MNRAS.475..379M} \cite{2017A&A...604A..93H}. Studying the peculiar velocity of galaxies allows us to infer the growth rate of LSS's. The growth of structures is halted at late times by the accelerated expansion of the universe and as a result of this, the kSZ is useful in the study of dark energy \cite{Xu_2013} \cite{2014PhLB..735..402M} \cite{2005astro.ph.11060D} \cite{2015ApJ...808...47M} \cite{Hernandez_Monteagudo_2006}. An alternative theory to dark energy is that of modified gravity, which suggests that modifications to GR can eradicate the need for inclusion of dark energy in Einstein's equations. Testing this theory also requires research into peculiar velocities and the growth of structure, which again suggests the use of the kSZ effect \cite{Bianchini_2016}. Apart from observable baryonic matter being only a mere fraction of the total matter, scientists are also uncertain of the whereabouts of a third of the baryonic matter. The SZ effect probes densities of electrons, which couple to baryons through Coulombic forces \cite{Miao_2016}\cite{2019arXiv191210152L} \cite{PhysRevLett.115.191301}, making it a useful tool in the 'missing baryon problem'. Another interesting area of research is reionization. The scattering of photons at the EoR, through the SZ effect, enables the study of the nature and duration of reionization \cite{Park_2013}\cite{Battaglia_2013} \cite{2006NewAR..50..909I} \cite{Alvarez_2016} \cite{Calabrese_2014} \cite{McQuinn_2005} \cite{2018MNRAS.476.4025M}. These are the main applications of the kSZ effect; more astrophysical and cosmological properties have been linked to the kSZ effect and have been studied. \\ 
The first direct detection of the kSZ signal occurred in \cite{Hand_2012} using pairwise estimation; a statistic that measures the momentum between pairs of clusters. Nearby clusters move towards each other due to gravity. The average pairwise momentum is measured using the line of sight momentum, together with information such as redshift and angular separation between the cluster pair. These are known properties that are obtained from galaxy catalogues such as Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), which is composed of $\sim 68 000$ galaxy sources. The approach of pairwise momentum is easier than measuring the 3D momentum of individual galaxies. The kSZ signal is directly proportional to the line of sight momentum. Therefore, CMB maps from ACT were used to find the line of sight momenta of pairs of clusters, which were then compared to the distance separation between these clusters, in order to see if the clusters were indeed falling towards each other. If this was the case, that would be proof of the kSZ effect. The paper gave promising results of a 0.2\% probability that the signal detected was due to random errors. The results from \cite{Hand_2012} were expanded upon in \cite{Bernardis_2017}, who also used ACT and BOSS to obtain signal-to-noise estimates between 3.6 and 4.1.\\ 
As mentioned already, one of the avenues which is pursued using the kSZ signal is that of missing baryons. The total baryonic composition is estimated from the CMB spectrum and has led researchers to the conclusion that a third of baryonic matter is left unaccounted for. Current evidence suggests that the missing baryons constitute the filamentary gas of the IGM, known as the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) \cite{2019A&A...624A..48D} \cite{2018Natur.558..406N}. The temperatures in these regions are typically about $10^5 K< T<10^7 K$ \cite{Shao_2011}. Detections in this region are difficult because the most abundant element in these filaments, hydrogen, is highly ionized at these temperatures and therefore has no spectral features. The partial ionization of heavier elements may produce extremely weak spectral lines at UV and X-ray wavelengths \cite{2018Natur.558..406N}. Two absorption lines of helium-like oxygen were detected and the combination of UV and X-ray data was used to estimate a baryon density of $9-40\%$ in this region. Another promising probe for detection of missing baryons in the IGM is the SZ effect, since it utilizes the hydrogen ionization and does not require spectral features. However, the thermal SZ is strongly dependent on the electron density and thus the tSZ dominates in high density and temperature regions such as the ICM. Since the missing baryons are more likely to reside in warm-hot regions of the less overdense filaments in the IGM, the tSZ is not ideal. Using tSZ stacking, the weak thermal signal was used to obtain an estimate for the baryon content of $28 \pm 12 \%$. Another promising avenue is the kSZ effect since the velocity is a large scale field, and is thus less biased by the local environment. However, a severe problem which greatly reduces our chances of using the kSZ signal for missing baryons is the projection effect. The signal is a measure of electron momentum from today until the EoR, which means redshift information of the missing baryons cannot be isolated and is instead accumulated. Furthermore, reionization could contribute a lot to the kSZ signal thereby introducing a bias. It is therefore necessary to isolate the correct redshift period so that we do not misinterpret reionization as our missing baryon signal. This work has already been carried out using CMB maps from Planck together with 40 000 galaxy systems of known positions, mass and velocities. The results found that the gas fraction in halos was close to the universal baryon fraction. The results were combined with those of the tSZ in order get a temperature estimate, which strongly supported the hypothesis that missing baryons reside in warm-hot regions of the IGM \cite{2019arXiv191210152L}. \\  
Another approach which can be used to study baryon content as well as its evolution involves cross correlating the kSZ and HI signals. Cross-correlation studies are widely used in literature as they allow for the correlation of two signals that provide different information, while also reducing noise, due to the uncorrelated noise of the different signals. Previous work has been done on HI-kSZ cross-correlations but much of this focused on reionization \cite{Cooray_2003} \cite{Alvarez_2016}; an epoch which can be probed effectively using both the HI and kSZ signals. This work was useful in attempting to understand the nature of reionization and constrain the redshift over which reionization occurred. In the post-reionization era, the HI-kSZ cross-correlation studies are recent. Research conducted by \cite{Li_2019} has looked at cross-correlating the HI density field with the kSZ signal using kSZ tomography \cite{Shao_2011}, which involves reconstructing the large scale peculiar velocity field and weighting this with the density field to produce a weighted momentum field \cite{Shao_2011}. This technique eliminates the projection effect, and provides redshift information which can be used to probe the evolution of baryons. The weighted momentum can be constructed with galaxy surveys or the HI signal, since both provide redshift information. This work was conducted in \cite{Li_2019} et al using the HI signal in the correlation. Signal-to-noise estimates for the cross correlation were then shown for two experiments, viz. CHIME and HIRAX but application of this to missing baryons was not conducted yet.\\
In this thesis we propose cross-correlating the neutral Hydrogen (HI) signal with the kSZ momentum signal. A weighted momentum signal is constructed through the convolution of the HI density and reconstructed HI velocity fields and is correlated with the kSZ momentum field. This eliminates the problem of the projection effect, since the HI signal will measure the evolution of baryons and remove any bias due to the contribution from reionization.\\ 
Theoretical predictions of detecting signals are not very meaningful without also discussing the instrument which will be used. The Hydrogen Intensity and Real-time Analysis eXperiment (HIRAX) telescope is under construction in South Africa and will consist of 1024 dishes \cite{2016SPIE.9906E..5XN}. Due to the weak nature of the HI signal which we hope to detect, the calibration of the telescope is extremely important. Systematic errors could easily swamp the signal. Therefore, a high level of precision is required in estimating the antennae gain errors.\\
The thesis layout is as follows. In chapter 2 we review basic cosmology, with an overview of basic GR, the equation of state, density parameters and distance measurements. Thereafter, we discuss the theory of inflation, the matter power spectrum and the CMB. The secondary scattering CMB anisotropies are discussed in more detail. We then move onto the neutral hydrogen signal in which we explain 21 cm cosmology and intensity mapping. Lastly, an introduction to the basics of radio interferometry describes visibilities and telescope noise. Chapter 3 expands on the HI-kSZ cross correlation and is divided into three sections. The first describes the kSZ auto-correlation signal and noise. Next, the HI signal and noise is explained in detail, followed by the final section on the computation of the bispectrum signal and noise. The chapter concludes with signal-to-noise estimates and future plans for parameter constraints. Chapter 4 discusses the systematics of HIRAX by discussing calibration techniques which we have considered in recovering antennae gains, so as to reduce gain uncertainty. At the end, we conclude with a discussion of the methodologies used and the results obtained for both the cross-correlation work and the calibration.
