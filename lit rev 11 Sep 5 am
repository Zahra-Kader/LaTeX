		dependence on neutrino mass}: Presents a set of cosmological hydrodynamical
		simulations that include a treatment of the neutrino component. Modelled the kSZ
		effect due to LSS’s after reionization and studied effect of reionisation redshift and
		neutrino mass on kSZ spectrum \cite{2017MNRAS.467..985R}
		\item \textit{SZ effects in the Magneticum Pathfinder simulation}: comparison with the Planck,

This paper extends the formalism in \cite{2017PhRvL.119b1301S} which addressed this problem \cite{2018arXiv180307036F}.
		\item \textit{The KBC Void: Consistency with Supernovae Type Ia and the Kinematic SZ Effect in a $\Gamma$ LTB Model}: There is evidence that the local universe is underdense on scales of several hundred megaparsecs. We test whether such a “void” is compatible with the latest supernovae type Ia data and with constraints from linear kSZ measurements \cite{2018ApJ...854...46H}. 
		\item \textit{Future constraints on halo thermodynamics from combined Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements}: The kSZ effect opens a new window into the thermodynamic properties of the baryons in halos. We propose a methodology to constrain these thermodynamic properties by combining the kSZ and tSZ to probe pressure and ionized electron density \cite{2017JCAP...11..040B}. 
		\item \textit{Detecting Patchy Reionization in the Cosmic Microwave Background}: Small-scale CMB fluctuations are a mixture of late-time effects: gravitational lensing, Doppler kSZ and residual foregrounds. We propose a new statistic which separates the KSZ signal from the others, and also allows the KSZ signal to be decomposed in redshift bins \cite{2017PhRvL.119b1301S}.
		\item \textit{Analyzing the cosmic variance limit of remote dipole measurements of the cosmic microwave background using the large-scale kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect}: We compute the large angular scale power asymmetry, constructing the appropriate transfer functions, and estimate the cosmic variance limited signal to noise for different redshift bin configurations. The paper investigates how close to the cosmic variance limit it will be possible to get \cite{2017JCAP...02..040T}. 
		\item \textit{A CMB Gibbs Sampler for Localized Secondary Anisotropies}: This paper uses Bayesian formalism to rigorously characterize anisotropies that are localized on the sky, taking the TSZ and KSZ effects as an example. This is an attempt to eliminate the problem of foreground contamination in CMB maps when studying secondary ansisotropies \cite{2015ApJS..219...10B}.

		\item \textit{Cosmological observations as a probe of fundamental physics and astrophysics}: The second part of this dissertation focuses on two secondary anisotropies, including the kSZ effect with the last chapter focusing on prospects of detecting the kSZ signal from sources for which accurate redshift information is not available (such as the WISE catalog). 
		\item \textit{Cosmic Microwave Background as a Probe of the Low Redshift Universe}:  Over the past few years, ACT, SPT and Planck have detected effects such as lensing and SZ through cross-correlations. This paper reviews how these observations measure the density, pressure and momentum in the intervening material and looks at upcoming observations \cite{2014AAS...22343503S}. 
		\item \textit{Reionization on Large Scales. II. Detecting Patchy Reionization through Cross-correlation of the Cosmic Microwave Background}: We investigate the effect of patchy reionization on the CMB. The kSZ is introduced in this paper and is used to show that patchy $\tau$ can still be detected at high significance \cite{2013ApJ...776...82N}.

The measurement is based on the kSZ effect \cite{2012arXiv1202.0717K}. 
		\item \textit{Correlation Properties of the Kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect and Implications for Dark Energy}: Paper presents detailed study of the statistical properties of the kSZ effect. Also conducts an analysis of the prospects of future high-resolution CMB experiments (such as ACT and SPT) for detecting the kSZ signal to extract cosmological information and dark energy constraints from it \cite{2006ApJ...643..598H}.
		\item \textit{Separating the Weak Lensing and Kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effects from Cosmic Microwave Background Temperature Maps}: The spectral form of anisotropies generated by the gravitational lensing and the kSZ effect are identical but have different statistical properties. Measuring this statistic can help us learn more about the EoR \cite{2007ApJ...661..672R}. 
		\item \textit{Looking the void in the eyes—the kinematic Sunyaev Zeldovich effect in Lemaître Tolman Bondi models}. This paper looks at kSZ observations in the LTB model as it gives far stronger constraints on the LTB model compared to other observational effects. If the LTB model is confirmed by observations, a kSZ survey gives a unique possibility of directly reconstructing the expansion rate and underdensity profile of the void \cite{2008JCAP...09..016G}. 
		\item \textit{Kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Cosmic Microwave Background Temperature Anisotropies Generated by Gas in Cosmic Structures}. If the gas in filaments and halos shares the same velocity field as the luminous matter, it will generate measurable temperature anisotropies due to the kSZ. Paper computes the distribution function of the KSZ signal produced by a typical filament \cite{2008ApJ...674L..61A}.

		\item \textit{Galaxy clusters as mirrors of the distant Universe. Implications of the blurring term for the kSZ and ISW effects}: CMB photons that are scattered off the line of sight cause a slight blurring of the CMB anisotropies present at the moment of scattering. This paper studies the blurring effect and finds that it can provide an independent measurement of the cluster's gas mass and also impacts estimations of the kSZ effect \cite{2010A&A...509A..82H}.

		\item \textit{Is There a Detectable Vishniac Effect?}: The OV effect is a dominant linear contribution to the CMB anisotropies at small scales. The paper points out that all odd higher order moments from Vishniac fluctuations are zero, while even moments are nonzero, regardless of the Gaussianity of the density perturbations \cite{2000ApJ...540...20S}.

Detection of the cross-correlation provides the strongest confirmation that the detected signal is of cosmological origin. Paper forecasts SKA detection of the kSZ effect after 1 year of observations \cite{2006ApJ...647..840A}.
