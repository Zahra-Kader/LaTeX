		\item \textit\textit{Kinetic Sunyaev–Zel’dovich eﬀect in rotating galaxy clusters from MUSIC simulations}: Update of the study of gas rotation in clusters through the maps of the kSZ, using a large sample of massive synthetic galaxy clusters from MUSIC high-resolution simulations. In the paper, the bulk velocity projected on the line of sight is recovered with the simulation true value \cite{2018MNRAS.479.4028B}.
		\item \textit{Cosmology with the pairwise kinematic SZ effect: calibration and validation using hydrodynamical simulations}: A study of the potential of the kSZ effect as a probe for cosmology, focusing on the pairwise method, using the Magneticum cosmological hydrodynamical simulations \cite{2018MNRAS.478.5320S}.
		\item \textit{Simulated reconstruction of the remote dipole field using the kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect}: Measurements of small-scale CMB anisotropies are combined with large-scale structure (LSS) surveys, a technique known as kSZ tomography. This paper investigate how well the remote dipole field (CMB dipole field at different locations) can be reconstructed using simulations \cite{2018arXiv180601290C}.
		\item \textit{Simulating the Galaxy Cluster "El Gordo": Gas Motion, Kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Signal, and X-Ray Line Features}: There are two proposed theories for the merging system of massive galaxy cluster "El Gordo" which results in different gas motions in the simulated clusters.

		dependence on neutrino mass}: Presents a set of cosmological hydrodynamical
		simulations that include a treatment of the neutrino component. Modelled the kSZ
		effect due to LSS’s after reionization and studied effect of reionisation redshift and
		neutrino mass on kSZ spectrum \cite{2017MNRAS.467..985R}
		\item \textit{SZ effects in the Magneticum Pathfinder simulation}: comparison with the Planck,
		SPT, and ACT results: calculate the one-point probability density distribution functions
		(PDF) and the power spectra of the tSZ and kSZ effects and the mean Compton Y parameter
		using the Magneticum Pathfinder simulations. Results agree with Planck \cite{2016MNRAS.463.1797D}.
		\item \textit{Probing the Missing Baryons via kSZ-Stacking}: This paper studies kSZ stacking in
		hydrodynamic simulations with different gastrophysics and measures the contribution from
		warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), which is believed to be the reservoir for most, if
		not all, missing baryons \cite{2016RAA....16...67M}.
		
		\item \textit{
			The observable thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in merging galaxy clusters}: Investigates the effects of cluster mergers on resolved SZE image using simulations. The paper shows that along certain projections the kSZ effect can dominate over the tSZ due to the large line-of-sight velocities \cite{2013MNRAS.432.3508R}. 
		\item \textit{Matched filter optimization of kSZ measurements with a reconstructed cosmological flow field}: Paper presents a new statistical method for measuring the kSZ effect using N-body simulations.

		\item  \textit{A direct measure of free electron gas via the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in Fourier-space analysis}: Measurement of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect in Fourier space. The density-weighted pairwise kSZ power spectrum is measured by cross-correlating a CMB temperature map, which jointly uses both Planck Release 2 and Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe nine-year data, with the two galaxy samples, CMASS and LOWZ, derived from BOSS \cite{2018MNRAS.475.3764S}.

Failure to account for it can lead to large biases in constraints on neutrino masses or the detection of dark energy \cite{2018PhRvD..97b3512F}.
		
		\item \textit{The detection of missing baryons in galaxy halos with kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect}: Presents kSZ signals from groups of galaxies as a function of halo mass using Planck CMB maps. The total kSZ flux within halos suggests that gas fraction in halos is about the universal baryon fraction, even in low-mass halos, indicating that the 'missing baryons' are found \cite{2017arXiv171208619L}.
		Planck intermediate results. LIII. Detection of velocity dispersion from the
		kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect: Detection of velocity dispersion due to kSZ effect
		from clusters. Meta Catalogue of X-ray detected Clusters of galaxies (MCXC) was
		used to determine the normalized rms dispersion of the temperature fluctuations at
		the positions of clusters. The study shows that cross-correlations of the kSZ effect
		with LSS’s can be used in order to constrain the growth of structure \cite{2017arXiv170700132P}.

		Combination of a cluster catalogue derived from the first year data of the Dark Energy
		Survey with CMB temperature maps from the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
		Survey. This measurement isolates the pairwise kSZ signal, providing the first detection of
		the large-scale, pairwise motion of clusters using redshifts derived from photometric data \cite{2016MNRAS.461.3172S}.

		Baryon Distribution with Planck, WMAP, and WISE Data}: Novel estimator for the
		KSZ—large-scale structure cross-correlation based on projected fields using Planck and
		WMAP, as well as a galaxy sample from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The
		consistency between the f b value found verifies that baryons approximately trace dark
		matter on Mpc scales \cite{2016PhRvL.117e1301H}.

		medium}: Proposes the use of the kSZ effect to probe the circumgalactic medium (CGM)
		with the aid of a spectroscopic survey covering the same area of a SZ survey. The cross-
		correlation is constructed between the estimator of the kSZ using the CGM, and the
		peculiar velocity recovered from the galaxy survey \cite{2016MNRAS.458.3773S}.
		\item \textit{Evidence for the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with the Atacama Cosmology
		Telescope and velocity reconstruction from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
		Survey}: Uses ACT and CMASS galaxy sample from BOSS to measure the kSZ effect. Used
		galaxy positions and the continuity equation to obtain a reconstruction of the line-of-sight
		velocity field. Techniques in the paper may be useful for the missing baryon problem and the
		role of feedback in galaxy groups and clusters \cite{2016PhRvD..93h2002S}.
		\item \textit{Planck intermediate results. XXXVII. Evidence of unbound gas from the kinetic
		Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect}: Estimate of the pairwise momentum of the kSZ temperature
		fluctuations at the positions of the Central Galaxy Catalogue (CGC) samples extracted from
		SDSS. Reconstructed the peculiar velocity field from the CG density field and computed the
		cross-correlation function between kSZ signal and CG estimates of radial peculiar velocities \cite{2016A&amp;A...586A.140P}
		\item \textit{Evidence of the Missing Baryons from the Kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect in
		Planck Data}: We estimate the amount of the missing baryons detected by the Planck
		measurements of the cosmic microwave background in the direction of central galaxies
		(CGs) identified in the Sloan galaxy survey \cite{2015PhRvL.115s1301H}

The paper looks at two subclusters of MACS J0717.5+3745, viz. B and C. The results show no kSZ signal towards the latter but a signal is detected towards subcluster B \cite{2013ApJ...778...52S}.
		\item \textit{The effect of dark matter and dark energy interactions on the peculiar velocity field and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect}: The interaction between Dark Matter and Dark Energy has been proposed as a mechanism to alleviate the coincidence problem. This paper analyzes its effects on gravitational and peculiar velocity fields. ACT and SPT data is used to solve the coincidence problem \cite{2013JCAP...12..001X}.

	\section{Theory papers}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item \textit{The Observations of Relic Radiation as a Test of the Nature of X-Ray Radiation from the Clusters of Galaxies}: First paper to explain the theory of the kSZ by relating the decrease in brightness of the CMB radiation to the intracluster medium (ICM) \cite{1972CoASP...4..173S}.
		\item \textit{The velocity of clusters of galaxies relative to the microwave background - The possibility of its measurement}: Investigates possibility of measuring the peculiar velocities of clusters relative to the CMB radiation \cite{1980MNRAS.190..413S}.
		\item \textit{ Cosmology with the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect}: A discussion of both the thermal and kinetic SZ effects and the cosmology that can be extracted from SZ surveys. Also discussed are observational and theoretical challenges, with single dish and interferometer radio telescopes, etc \cite{2002ARA&A..40..643C}.
		\item \textit{Constraining galaxy cluster velocity field with the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich cross bispectrum}: Explores the feasibility of detecting the kSZ through the computation of the tSZ-CMB-CMB cross correlation bispectrum for current and future CMB experiments. The paper concludes that the next generation of CMB experiments will offer the possibility to detect the tSZ-kSZ-kSZ bispectrum at high S/N \cite{2017A&A...604A..93H}.
		\item \textit{Reconstruction of the remote dipole and quadrupole fields from the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and polarized Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects}: This paper presents a set of unbiased minimum variance quadratic estimators for the reconstruction of the dipole and quadrupole fields, and forecast the ability of future CMB experiments and LSS surveys to perform this reconstruction in the cosmic variance limit \cite{2017arXiv170708129D}. 
		\item \textit{An SZ-Selected Sample of the Most Massive Galaxy Clusters in the 2500-Square-Degree South Pole Telescope Survey}: This paper presents a catalog of the 26 most significant SZ cluster detections in a full SPT survey of 2500 square degrees of the southern sky. Clusters were selected based on their SZ signal-to-noise (S/N) \cite{2011ApJ...738..139W}
		\item \textit{Measuring the baryon fraction in cluster of galaxies with Kinematic
		Sunyeav Zeldovich and a Standard Candle}: Measures the baryon fraction in
		cluster of galaxies using Type Ia supernovae that reside in a brightest cluster galaxy of
		low redshift clusters. In low redshifts the supernovae can be used to measure the bulk
		velocity of a galaxy cluster. This paper shows the bulk flow of the cluster and CMB
		distortion due to kSZ can constrain the clusters baryon fraction \cite{2017arXiv170302021B}.

		\item \textit{Will kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements enhance the science return
		from galaxy redshift surveys?} Yes. Future CMB experiments will provide
		measurements of the linear growth rate and universe expansion rate. This paper
		emphasizes that there is significant information in the anisotropy of the relative pairwise
		kSZ measurements \cite{2017JCAP...01..057S}.
		\item \textit{Extracting late-time kinetic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect}: Novel technique to separate the
		late-time, post-reionization component of the kSZ effect from the contribution to it from
		reionization by reconstructing 3D maps from future spectroscopic surveys and cross
		correlating with CMB maps \cite{2016MNRAS.463.2425M}.
		
		\item \textit{Reconstructing cosmic growth with kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
		observations in the era of stage IV experiments}: Method for constraining the
		growth rate of structure to sub-1% precision out to z ≈1 , using a combination of galaxy
		cluster peculiar velocities measured using the kSZ effect, and the velocity field
		reconstructed from galaxy redshift surveys \cite{2016PhRvD..94d3522A}.
		\item \textit{Kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in modified gravity}: Investigates the impact of
		modified theories of gravity on the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect of the cosmic
		microwave background. We focus on a specific class of f (R ) models of gravity and compare
		their predictions for the kSZ power spectrum to that of the $\Gamma$ CDM model \cite{2016PhRvD..93f4026B}.
		\item \textit{Constraints on massive neutrinos from the pairwise kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
		effect}: Mean pairwise momentum of clusters, as observed through the kSZ effect, as a
		novel probe of massive neutrinos. Forecasts give estimate of neutrino constraints using
		cross-correlations of CMB measurements and spectroscopic galaxy survey \cite{2015PhRvD..92f3501M}.
		\item \textit{Constraints on Gravity and Dark Energy from the Pairwise Kinematic Sunyaev-
		Zel'dovich Effect}: Calculates constraints on dark energy and cosmic modifications to gravity
		achievable with CMB surveys sensitive to SZ effects. Results suggest that kSZ measurements
		of mean pairwise velocity of clusters could provide robust tests of dark energy and theories
		of gravity on cosmic scales \cite{2015ApJ...808...47M}.
		\item \textit{Testing eternal inflation with the kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect}: The multiverse
		theory is that our universe is contained in a bubble surrounded by others. This theory is
		tested by looking for evidence of the relic inhomogeneities left by the collisions between
		other bubbles and our own. Such relic inhomogeneities will induce a coherent bulk flow over
		Gpc scales. Bubble collisions leave unique imprints in the CMB through the kSZ effect \cite{2015JCAP...06..046Z}.

		\item \textit{On scattering of CMB radiation on wormholes: kinetic SZ effect}: It is shown that a
		static gas of wormholes does not perturb the spectrum of CMB. In the first order by $v/c$
		the presence of peculiar velocities gives rise to the dipole contribution in $\Delta T/T$,
		which corresponds to the well-known kSZ effect \cite{2015arXiv150505952K}. 
		\item \textit{Prospects for Measuring the Relative Velocities of Galaxy Clusters in Photometric Surveys Using the Kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect}: Considers the prospects for measuring the pairwise kSZ signal from clusters in large photometric surveys such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and projects a detection of the pairwise kSZ signal. Also considers consider using the measurements for constraining theories of modified gravity \cite{2013ApJ...765L..32K}.
		\item \textit{Using the kSZ effect to measure the galaxy velocity field}: Procedure to measure the kSZ signal as a function of redshift from ACT maps weighted by maps from Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS) \cite{2012AfrSk..16..147Z}.
		\item \textit{The Kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect from Reionization}: Discusses the kSZ anisotropy from patchy reionization and shows that the angular power spectrum of the kSZ anisotropies depends strongly on the size distribution of the H II bubbles and on the duration of reionization \cite{2005ApJ...630..643M}.
		
		\item \textit{The kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signal from inhomogeneous reionization: a parameter space study}: Computes the kSZ signal at reionization from 100 reionization models using the publicly available code 21CMFAST and predicts kSZ shape and amplitude is affected by the astrophysics of the early universe. 
		\item \textit{Linear kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and void models for acceleration}: There is a theory that the acceleration of the universe is due to a very large local underdensity, or void, instead of dark energy. This paper examines a new proposal to constrain such models using the linear kSZ effect due to the structure within the void \cite{2011CQGra..28p4005Z}.
		
		\item \textit{Measuring patchy reionization with kSZ2-21 cm correlations}: Study of cross-correlations between kSZ and 21-cm at EoR to measure the effects of patchy reionization. The kSZ-21 cm cross correlation suffers from cancellation at small angular scales. Paper thus focuses on the correlation between the kSZ-squared field and 21 cm signals \cite{2018MNRAS.476.4025M}.
		
		\item \textit{Characterizing the Epoch of Reionization with the small-scale CMB: constraints on the optical depth and physical parameters}: The CMB power spectrum is largely degenerate with the kSZ signal produced by late-time galaxies and clusters, limiting our ability to constrain reionization. This paper extends the formalism in \cite{2017PhRvL.119b1301S} which addressed this problem \cite{2018arXiv180307036F}.
		\item \textit{The KBC Void: Consistency with Supernovae Type Ia and the Kinematic SZ Effect in a $\Gamma$ LTB Model}: There is evidence that the local universe is underdense on scales of several hundred megaparsecs. We test whether such a “void” is compatible with the latest supernovae type Ia data and with constraints from linear kSZ measurements \cite{2018ApJ...854...46H}. 
		\item \textit{Future constraints on halo thermodynamics from combined Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements}: The kSZ effect opens a new window into the thermodynamic properties of the baryons in halos. We propose a methodology to constrain these thermodynamic properties by combining the kSZ and tSZ to probe pressure and ionized electron density \cite{2017JCAP...11..040B}. 
		\item \textit{Detecting Patchy Reionization in the Cosmic Microwave Background}: Small-scale CMB fluctuations are a mixture of late-time effects: gravitational lensing, Doppler kSZ and residual foregrounds. We propose a new statistic which separates the KSZ signal from the others, and also allows the KSZ signal to be decomposed in redshift bins \cite{2017PhRvL.119b1301S}.
		\item \textit{Analyzing the cosmic variance limit of remote dipole measurements of the cosmic microwave background using the large-scale kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect}: We compute the large angular scale power asymmetry, constructing the appropriate transfer functions, and estimate the cosmic variance limited signal to noise for different redshift bin configurations. The paper investigates how close to the cosmic variance limit it will be possible to get \cite{2017JCAP...02..040T}.
